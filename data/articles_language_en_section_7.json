                "Continut": "<p><strong>To mark 25 years since Moldova declared independence from the Soviet Union, here are a few things you probably didn't know about the country.</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>1. It’s the least visited country in Europe</strong></p>\r\n<p>If you do venture to Moldova for your holidays, you won’t be jostling for space with other tourists: only 94,000 foreigners are reported to have entered the country last year, making it the least visited in Europe. On a global scale only Bangladesh and Guinea are less popular destinations, according to Priceonomics. </p>\r\n<p><strong>\n\t <div align=\"center\"> \t\t<div class=\"cs_img cs_fl_middle\"  style=\"width:610px;\">\n\t\t\t <p><a href=\"/images/cms-image-000000234.jpg\" class=\"photoViewer\" title=\"\"> \t\t\t\t<img src=\"/get_img?ImageWidth=610&amp;ImageHeight=658&amp;ImageId=234\"   border=\"0\"/>\n\t\t\t </a></p> \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>2. </strong><strong>It keeps a fine cellar</strong></p>\r\n<p>According to the venerable folk at Guinness World Records, the Mileștii Mici wine cellar in Moldova is the world’s largest with nearly two million bottles of plonk in its darkened vaults. In case you’re wondering, the most valuable tipples in its collection sell for a reported €480 each.</p>\r\n<p>\n\t <div align=\"center\"> \t\t<div class=\"cs_img cs_fl_middle\"  style=\"width:610px;\">\n\t\t\t <p><a href=\"/images/cms-image-000000235.jpg\" class=\"photoViewer\" title=\"\"> \t\t\t\t<img src=\"/get_img?ImageWidth=610&amp;ImageHeight=658&amp;ImageId=235\"   border=\"0\"/>\n\t\t\t </a></p> \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</p>\r\n<p><strong>3. </strong><strong>Its wine is banned in Russia   </strong></p>\r\n<p>Traditionally Moldova’s biggest export market was Russia, which consumed up to 90 per cent of its wine. However, a diplomatic dispute in 2006 resulted in a Russian ban on Moldovan and Georgian produce, which has been devastating for its economy. Nevertheless, it remains the 22nd largest wine-producing nation on Earth.</p>\r\n<p><strong>4. </strong><strong>There are some magnificent monasteries</strong></p>\r\n<p>Moldova’s most important (and, arguably, most beautiful) historical site, Orheiul Vechi is a crumbling open-air monastic complex that dates back more than 2,000 years. The rambling ruins feature ancient fortifications, baths and monasteries, which you’ll have largely to yourself. </p>\r\n<p>\n\t <div align=\"center\"> \t\t<div class=\"cs_img cs_fl_middle\"  style=\"width:610px;\">\n\t\t\t <p><a href=\"/images/cms-image-000000236.jpg\" class=\"photoViewer\" title=\"\"> \t\t\t\t<img src=\"/get_img?ImageWidth=610&amp;ImageHeight=658&amp;ImageId=236\"   border=\"0\"/>\n\t\t\t </a></p> \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</p>\r\n<p><strong>5. </strong><strong>It went nearly three years without a president</strong></p>\r\n<p>In 2012, after nearly three years of political deadlock, Moldova elected the veteran judge, Nicolae Timofti, as president – for the first time in 917 days, the country had a leader. Timofti is still in power today. </p>\r\n<p><strong>6. Most Moldovans are bi- or tri-lingual</strong></p>\r\n<p>Moldovans speak either Romanian, which is the native language, Russian or Gagauz. Some speak all three. </p>\r\n<p><strong>7. It has a critically endangered language</strong></p>\r\n<p>However, Moldova’s second language, Gagauz, is in danger of dying out. Spoken in the Autonomous Region of Gagauz, the Turkic language is classed as critically endangered by Unesco. </p>\r\n<p><strong>8. It’s poor</strong></p>\r\n<p>Moldova has the dubious distinction of being the poorest country in Europe with a per capita GDP of just $1,843 (£1,395), according to the World Bank. To put that into perspective, consider this: nearby Bulgaria, the poorest member of the European Union, has a GDP of $6,819 (£5,163).</p>\r\n<p><strong>9. It's home to Europe’s most unlikely tourist attraction</strong></p>\r\n<p>Despite being surrounded by poverty, rich residents in the town of Soroca have taken to flaunting their wealth by building flamboyant homes inspired by landmarks such as St Peter’s Basilica and the Bolshoi theatre. Consequently, the town, dubbed Gypsy Hill, has become something of an tourist attraction, with people coming to admire the madcap architecture.</p>\r\n<p>\n\t <div align=\"center\"> \t\t<div class=\"cs_img cs_fl_middle\"  style=\"width:610px;\">\n\t\t\t <p><a href=\"/images/cms-image-000000237.jpg\" class=\"photoViewer\" title=\"\"> \t\t\t\t<img src=\"/get_img?ImageWidth=610&amp;ImageHeight=658&amp;ImageId=237\"   border=\"0\"/>\n\t\t\t </a></p> \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</p>\r\n<p><strong>10. The capital was destroyed in 1940</strong></p>\r\n<p>Having been invaded by the Red Army in June 1940, Chisinau suffered a deadly earthquake in October of that year which measured 7.3 on the Richter scale and destroyed much of the city. As if that wasn’t enough, the following year the Luftwaffe arrived and blew what was left of the city to smithereens. </p>\r\n<p><strong>11. It has a breakaway territory</strong></p>\r\n<p>The region known as Transnistria declared independence from Moldova in 1990, precipitating the War of Transnistria which secured a de facto independence for the territory. However, the region, which has its own currency and border controls, is not officially recognised by any member of the United Nations.</p>\r\n<p>\n\t <div align=\"center\"> \t\t<div class=\"cs_img cs_fl_middle\"  style=\"width:610px;\">\n\t\t\t <p><a href=\"/images/cms-image-000000238.jpg\" class=\"photoViewer\" title=\"\"> \t\t\t\t<img src=\"/get_img?ImageWidth=610&amp;ImageHeight=658&amp;ImageId=238\"   border=\"0\"/>\n\t\t\t </a></p> \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</p>\r\n<p><strong>12. It’s the second booziest nation on Earth</strong></p>\r\n<p>According to the World Health Organisation, only Belarus tucks away more alcohol than Moldova, with each inhabitant drinking an average of 16.8 litres of booze per year (excluding under 15s).  </p>\r\n<p><strong>13. It’s landlocked</strong></p>\r\n<p>Well, technically. In a bid to gain access to the Black Sea, Moldova did in fact make a territorial exchange with Ukraine in 2005, giving the country access to a 600m stretch of the River Danube, which flows into the Black Sea. </p>\r\n<p><strong>14. There’s a beach</strong></p>\r\n<p>Despite having no access to the sea, Moldova does have a slither of sand to speak of on Chisinau Lake, which is located in the capital, Chisinau. Okay, so it’s a man-made beach and it’s in a city, but if you close your eyes you could almost be on the coast. Sort of.  </p>\r\n<p>\n\t <div align=\"center\"> \t\t<div class=\"cs_img cs_fl_middle\"  style=\"width:610px;\">\n\t\t\t <p><a href=\"/images/cms-image-000000239.jpg\" class=\"photoViewer\" title=\"\"> \t\t\t\t<img src=\"/get_img?ImageWidth=610&amp;ImageHeight=658&amp;ImageId=239\"   border=\"0\"/>\n\t\t\t </a></p> \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</p>\r\n<p><strong>15. It’s great for twitchers</strong></p>\r\n<p>Moldova is home to an impressive array of birds, with roughly 300 different species calling it home. Some are year-round residents, some come to breed, some simply pass through en route to warmer climes, and others come to escape harsh winters further north. All of which is good news for birders.</p>\r\n<p><strong>16. The national animal is a big cow</strong></p>\r\n<p>Or an auroch, to be precise. These beefy bovines are now extinct, but have been immortalised on Moldova's flag, which features the head of an auroch mounted on a shield (probably why they’re extinct, if they kept mounting them on shields). Zimbru Stadium, the country's main football stadium, takes its name from the Romanian word for bison.</p>\r\n<p>\n\t <div align=\"center\"> \t\t<div class=\"cs_img cs_fl_middle\"  style=\"width:610px;\">\n\t\t\t <p><a href=\"/images/cms-image-000000240.jpg\" class=\"photoViewer\" title=\"\"> \t\t\t\t<img src=\"/get_img?ImageWidth=610&amp;ImageHeight=658&amp;ImageId=240\"   border=\"0\"/>\n\t\t\t </a></p> \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</p>\r\n<p><strong>17. It debuted at Eurovision in 2005</strong></p>\r\n<p>Which remains Moldova’s most successful year with Zdob și Zdub finishing sixth.</p>\r\n<p><strong>18. It's super cheap</strong></p>\r\n<p>A one-way ticket on Chișinău's tramway costs 2MDL – a mere 7 pence. A monthly pass will set you back £7 – that's for a whole 30 days of unlimited travel. Take note, TfL.</p>\r\n<p><strong>19. The national dish is porridge</strong></p>\r\n<p>Ubiquitous on Moldovan dinner tables, Mămăligă is a porridge made out of yellow maize flour and often considered the country’s national dish. It’s traditionally served as an accompaniment to stews and meat dishes, and is commonly garnished with cottage cheese, sour cream or pork rind.</p>\r\n<p>\n\t <div align=\"center\"> \t\t<div class=\"cs_img cs_fl_middle\"  style=\"width:610px;\">\n\t\t\t <p><a href=\"/images/cms-image-000000241.jpg\" class=\"photoViewer\" title=\"\"> \t\t\t\t<img src=\"/get_img?ImageWidth=610&amp;ImageHeight=658&amp;ImageId=241\"   border=\"0\"/>\n\t\t\t </a></p> \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</p>\r\n<p><strong>20. It has a whole day dedicated to wine</strong></p>\r\n<p>Actually, it's more of a two-day event. Wine producers open up their homes and vineyards to the masses on October 3-4 for National Wine Day, in a country-wide celebration of local hooch. Wine tastings are cheap, and there's even a free bus to shuttle you between wineries.</p>\r\n<p><strong>21. Its history stretches back for millenia</strong></p>\r\n<p>Ancient tools dating back 1.2 million years have been found in some of Moldova's key archeological sites. The flint relics were added to the national hoard of Paleolithic and Neolithic artefacts that includes jewellery, weapons and cooking utensils. </p>\r\n<p><strong>22. It likes to make a song and dance</strong></p>\r\n<p>As with its languages, Moldovan music is greatly influenced by Romania. Miorița, a traditional Romanian ballad about sheep, is a Moldovan favourite – so much so, that the first two verses are printed on its banknotes. </p>\r\n<p><strong>23. They're strong</strong></p>\r\n<p>Nicolae Birliba is a world champion weightlifter, nine times over. In 2011, aged 49, he rasied a 16kg kettlebell 2,575 times. </p>\r\n<p><strong>24. You'll have to take your shoes off</strong></p>\r\n<p>When you're entering someone's home, it's considered impolite to leave your shoes on. Leave them at the door. The house rule applies in most formerly Soviet countries, for hygiene reasons. Guests are almost always provided with slippers. </p>\r\n<p>\n\t <div align=\"center\"> \t\t<div class=\"cs_img cs_fl_middle\"  style=\"width:610px;\">\n\t\t\t <p><a href=\"/images/cms-image-000000242.jpg\" class=\"photoViewer\" title=\"\"> \t\t\t\t<img src=\"/get_img?ImageWidth=610&amp;ImageHeight=658&amp;ImageId=242\"   border=\"0\"/>\n\t\t\t </a></p> \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</p>\r\n<p><strong>25. It loves Christmas</strong></p>\r\n<p>Moldova celebrates Christmas from December 24 to 26, unlike its Russian-Orthodox neighbours (their main event is in January). Traditional preparations start in November, with the baking of cakes and the slaughtering of pigs, and culminate in three days of feasting, parties and gift-giving. The Russian Father Frost fairytale was banned after Moldova gained independence: these days, children's presents are delivered by Mos Craciun – who looks remarkably like our Santa Claus.</p>\r\n<p>Source: <a href=\"http://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/europe/articles/amazing-facts-about-moldova/\" target=\"_blank\">The Telegraph</a></p>",

Nicolae Timofti said that the amendment of Article 13 in the Constitution is an obligation of the Parliament.</strong></p>\r\n<p>The Head of State recalled the events of the years 1988-1989, when the Moldovan society has entered the path of truth and mentioned the name of intellectuals who fought for the national liberation movement.</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p><em>\"Grand National Assembly Square was back then a sea full of souls thirsty for freedom and democracy. I had to choose between Romanian and a different reading of the Romanian language. Then was raised the duality of this issue. In the Declaration of Independence is taken into account the opinion of writers, linguists, this opinion being supported by hundreds of thousands of letters that reached at the Romanian language newspapers and finally the Declaration of Independence to caonsent to Romanian language as state language\"</em>, specified Nicolae Timofti.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>Nicolae Timofti also said that modifying the 13th amendment from Constitution  is a obligation of the Parliament.  </p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p><em>\"The modification of the 13th amendment means a gesture of political and legal correctness from the Parliament in order to carry through the decision of Constitutional Court. More than that, this is how it should be in a democratic country... The continuum circulation of two names of the same language means to slit up further on of our society. Each one who refuses to understand this is against development of our state. We can no longer walk on the path of non-truth. This kind of hesitations should be stooped a long time ago. We are Romanians, even if we call ourselves Moldovans\"</em>, added the President. </p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>Timofti also said that he consider himself as an Romanian, as all the citizens of Moldova are.</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p><em>\"<em>During my discussions with the Presidents of other countries I have always said I am Romanian, as my parents, my grandparents and all those who live on this land. My advice is not to depart from our path and follow the European development vector. We must have a system of scientific research and innovations connected to the European level, have a health care system that suits current requirements, a professional judicial system which citizens can trust and an economy that is operating. We must bring back the citizens' trust in the state and be exigent with the political class. We have a lot to do\", concluded Timofti.</em></em></p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>Yesterday, took place many cultural events on the occasion of National Day of the Romanian Language. The officials laid flowers at the Stefan cel Mare si Sfant monument and at the busts of writers on the Alley of Classics. In the public garden \"Stefan cel Mare\" took place poetry recital, music recital, ceramics exposition, hand made exposition and many folk groups evolved on the stage. In the evening of August 31, on the Grand National Assembly Square was organised a concert with the participation of local artists.</p>",

The text of the play was written especially for the theater from Craiova by Matei Visniec, a French playwright from Romania. The author gives a dramaturgical load to the train as a symbolic element of our people's history in the last century. </p>\r\n<p>The six actors, three men and three women, personify the world that we frequently meet in train stations: beggars and emigrants, business travelers and prostitutes, tourists and soldiers etc. The scenes presented by these characters seem cliches of the ordinary life. We must realize that these so called other people's stories, are actually ours. </p>\r\n<p>The premiere happened in May 2009 in an European theater project.</p>\r\n<p>The spectators appreciated both the play, and the event itself, showing desire for the organization of similar theatrical projects, that offer the possibility to those fond of art to enjoy the moments favorable to the soul and culture. </p>\r\n<p>The event took place with the support of the National Theater \"Mihai Eminescu\", Ministry of Transport and SOE „Calea Ferata din Moldova”. </p>\r\n<p><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/WkX6k-uTa80\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p> </p>",

But he thought that would be weird, so I wore my swim shorts,\" Elden told The Post.</p>\r\n<p>\"The anniversary means something to me. It's strange that I did this for five minutes when I was four months old and it became this really iconic image.\"</p>\r\n<p>Spencer Elden was the naked baby in the pool in the iconic album cover. </p>\r\n<p>Nevermind has sold more than 30 million copies worldwide. </p>\r\n<p><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/G3kmLzLlmvo\" width=\"854\" height=\"480\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>Source: <a href=\"http://www.abc.net.au/news/2016-09-24/nirvana-nevermind-turns-25/7874520\" target=\"_blank\">ABC News</a></p>\r\n<p> </p>",

                "lead": "The singer and songwriter Bob Dylan was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature on Thursday for “having created new poetic expressions within the great American song tradition,” in the words of the Swedish Academy. In doing so, the prolific musician became the first American to win the prize in more than two decades.",
                "Continut": "<p>The win comes as something of a shock. As usual, the Swedish Academy did not announce a shortlist of nominees, leaving the betting markets to their best guesses. And while Dylan has enjoyed perennial favor as an outside shot for the award, few expected that the musician would be the first to break the Americans' long dry spell — not least because he made his career foremost on the stage, not the printed page.</p>\r\n<p>Yet few would argue Dylan has been anything but influential, both in the U.S. and beyond its borders. The prolific singer, songwriter and multi-instrumentalist has produced dozens of albums, including <em>The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan</em>, <em>Highway 61 Revisited</em> and <em>Blood on the Tracks</em>. His track \"Like a Rolling Stone\" has taken on mythic standing in the decades since its release; many, including Dylan himself, have pointed to it as emblematic of a sea change in American music.</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p><em>\"Mr. Dylan’s work remains utterly lacking in conventionality, moral sleight of hand, pop pabulum or sops to his audience,\"</em> Bill Wyman wrote in a 2013 Op-Ed essay in The New York Times arguing the case for Mr. Dylan’s getting the award. <em>\"His lyricism is exquisite; his concerns and subjects are demonstrably timeless; and few poets of any era have seen their work bear more influence.\"</em></p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>The Nobel Prize in Literature has been awarded since 1901 to writers who have produced \"the most outstanding work in an ideal direction.\" In that time, 109 prizes have been distributed to 113 writers. This year, the prize carries with it a purse of approximately $900,000 and, as usual, inclusion on literature's most illustrious list — the pantheon of Nobel winners.</p>\r\n<p>The 75-year-old artist will receive his award in Stockholm, Sweden, on Dec. 10.</p>\r\n<p>Source: <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/14/arts/music/bob-dylan-nobel-prize-literature.html?_r=0\" target=\"_blank\">New York Times</a></p>",

                "Continut": "<p>\"It is with great sadness that we can confirm our beloved son, brother and friend George passed away peacefully at home over the Christmas period,\" the publicist said in a statement.</p>\r\n<div class=\"line textcontent_img watermark\">\r\n<p>Thames Valley Police said the ambulance service had attended his property in Goring in Oxfordshire, at 13:42 GMT on Sunday and confirmed he is dead at the scene. Billboard magazine said the singer had died of heart failure.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>Singer Elton John published a picture of himself with Michael on his Instagram account.</p>\r\n<p>\"I am in deep shock. I have lost a beloved friend - the kindest, most generous soul and a brilliant artist,\" the British star wrote.</p>\r\n<p>Michael was due to release a documentary in 2017 after a period of living as a virtual recluse in which he hit the headlines for a series of bizarre incidents linked to drugs.</p>\r\n<p>Earlier this month it was also announced that producer and songwriter Naughty Boy, whose real name is Shahid Khan, was working with Michael on a new album for next year.</p>\r\n<p>Michael was best known for his 1980s hits \"Last Christmas\", \"Freedom\", \"Careless Whisper\" and \"Wake Me Up Before You Go Go\" but his career spanned more than three decades.</p>\r\n<p>He won a string of awards including two Grammies and three Brits. His last album \"Symphonica\" (2014) rose to number one in the charts.</p>\r\n<p>Michael was born Georgios Kyriacos Panayiotou to a Greek Cypriot father and English mother in north London in 1963.</p>\r\n<div class=\"line textcontent_img watermark\">\r\n<p>Following years of speculation over his sexuality, Michael came out as gay in 1998 after being arrested for committing a lewd act in the public toilet of a Los Angeles park. It was the first of several incidents that were to overshadow his musical career in his later years.</p>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>He notched up police cautions for cannabis and crack cocaine possession and in 2010 was sentenced to eight weeks in jail after crashing his car into a London shop while under the influence of cannabis and prescription medication.</p>\r\n<p>In 2011, he spent several weeks in hospital in Vienna after contracting pneumonia, later saying that he had been close to death.</p>\r\n<p>There were fresh concerns in 2013 when he had to be airlifted to hospital after falling out of his chauffeur-driven Range Rover as it travelled at high speed on a motorway.</p>\r\n<p>Source: <a href=\"https://www.afp.com/en/news/23/british-pop-star-george-michael-dies-aged-53\" target=\"_blank\">AFP</a></p>",
