In Syria, Russia supports President Bashar al-Assad whom Western governments want to see leave power and Russian aircraft have carried out strikes on U.S.-back rebels.</p>\r\n<p>The BIS warned that Russian agents sought to stoke social and political tensions in the country by using puppet groups and supporting populist and extremist groups.</p>\r\n<p>\"The infrastructure created for achieving these goals will not disappear with the end of the two conflicts,\" BIS said.</p>\r\n<p>\"It can be used to destabilize or manipulate Czech society or political environment at any time, if Russia wishes to do so.\"</p>\r\n<p>Fears of Russian interference in countries along the European Union's eastern flank, especially in the Baltics, are growing in the wake of the Ukrainian crisis and NATO has been looking to beef up its defenses.</p>\r\n<p>Additionally a pro-Russian lobby in Czech Republic seeks to boost relations with Russia, while its popular president, Milos Zeman, expresses pro-Russian views.</p>\r\n<p>He has spoken out against EU sanctions on Russia and was the only Western leader to attend the May 2015 celebrations in Moscow to mark the end of WW2, when other Western heads of state stayed away.</p>\r\n<p>Russian intelligence agents, the BIS report said, sought to weaken Czech media through infiltration and by spreading propaganda and disinformation.</p>\r\n<p>The tactics included relativization of truth and objectivity, and promoting the view that all sides lie, the report said.</p>\r\n<p>BIS said \"a large number\" of Russian intelligence officers were working undercover as part of the Russian embassy in Prague, which is by far the largest foreign mission in the country with around 140 staff, twice as many as the U.S. mission.</p>\r\n<p>In Moscow, there was no immediate comment from the Federal Security Service to the BIS charge, nor was the Russian embassy in Prague immediately available for comment.</p>\r\n<p>Zeman's spokesman made no immediate comment to emailed questions.</p>",

A Russian court will rule whether the ban will remain in place at a later date. </p>\r\n<p>Russia blocked the Russian page of Pornhub site last year, when a a court in the southern city of Krasnodar ruled that the website violated child protection laws. The court also ruled the site illegally produced and distributed pornography, a crime punishable by two to six years in prison.</p>\r\n<p>Roskomnadzor stood by its 2015 ban despite a somewhat tongue-in-cheek social media backlash. When one Russian Twitter user asked Roskomnadzor: \"If you block Pornhub, could you offer an alternative?\", The government watchdog's official Twitter account replied: \"as an alternative, you could meet someone in real life.\"</p>\r\n<p>The Russian government has previously banned other popular sites, including online encyclopedia Wikipedia, in short-lived disputes. In addition, Youporn.com was blocked along with Pornhub. </p>\r\n<p>In April, Roskomnadzor announced that it intends to block 136 websites with adult content.</p>\r\n<p>Source: <a href=\"https://themoscowtimes.com/news/russia-blocks-access-to-pornhub-55334\" target=\"_blank\">The Moscow Times</a></p>",

                "Continut": "<p>Bush, 92, had intended to stay silent on the White House race between Clinton and Donald Trump, a sign in and of itself of his distaste for the GOP nominee. But his preference for the wife of his own successor, President Bill Clinton, nonetheless became known to a wider audience thanks to Kathleen Hartington Kennedy Townsend, the former Maryland lieutenant governor and daughter of the late Robert F. Kennedy.</p>\r\n<p>On Monday, Townsend posted a picture on her Facebook page shaking hands next to the former president and this caption: \"The President told me he’s voting for Hillary!!”</p>\r\n<p>In a telephone interview, Townsend said she met with the former president in Maine earlier today, where she said he made his preference known that he was voting for a Democrat. “That’s what he said,” she told POLITICO.</p>\r\n<p>\n\t <div align=\"center\"> \t\t<div class=\"cs_img cs_fl_middle\"  style=\"width:587px;\">\n\t\t\t <p><a href=\"/images/cms-image-000001320.jpg\" class=\"photoViewer\" title=\"Kathleen Kennedy Townsend poses with George H W Bush in a photograph posted on Facebook \"> \t\t\t\t<img src=\"/get_img?ImageWidth=587&amp;ImageHeight=588&amp;ImageId=1320\" alt=\"Kathleen Kennedy Townsend poses with George H W Bush in a photograph posted on Facebook \" title=\"Kathleen Kennedy Townsend poses with George H W Bush in a photograph posted on Facebook \"  border=\"0\"/>\n\t\t\t </a></p> \t\t\t                                    <p class=\"cs_img_caption\">Kathleen Kennedy Townsend poses with George H W Bush in a photograph posted on Facebook </p>\n                            \t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</p>\r\n<p>Asked about Townsend’s post, George H.W. Bush spokesman Jim McGrath in an email replied, \"The vote President Bush will cast as a private citizen in some 50 days will be just that: a private vote cast in some 50 days. He is not commenting on the presidential race in the interim.\"</p>\r\n<p>George H.W. Bush and former First Lady Barbara Bush have stayed out of the political debate since campaigning earlier this year for their son Jeb's unsuccessful bid for president. Neither George H.W. Bush nor his son, former President George W. Bush, attended this summer's Republican National Convention in Cleveland where Trump accepted the nomination.</p>\r\n<p>Many former GOP officials from both Bush administrations have also announced their support for Clinton over Trump, including national security adviser Brent Scowcroft and former Commerce Secretary Carlos Gutierrez.</p>\r\n<p>One Bush official who has taken Trump's side is former Vice President Dan Quayle, who told POLITICO in an <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2016/07/dan-quayle-mike-pence-vp-225665\" target=\"_blank\">interview</a> this summer he was still holding out hope both Bushes would back Trump. \"Clearly in their heart of hearts I should hope they would want a Republican president, but they can speak for themselves,\" Quayle said in an interview in July.</p>\r\n<p>Source: <a href=\"http://www.politico.com/story/2016/09/exclusive-george-hw-bush-to-vote-for-hillary-228395\" target=\"_blank\">POLITICO</a></p>\r\n<p><br /><br /></p>",

The Crimean Peninsula participated in the vote for the first time since rejoining Russia in March 2014.</p>\r\n<p>Crimea reunified with Russia after over 96 percent of the local population supported the move in a 2014 referendum following the coup in Kiev that toppled former President Viktor Yanukovich. Kiev, as well as the West, did not recognize the move and considers the peninsula an occupied territory.<br /><br />Source: <a href=\"https://sputniknews.com/politics/20160919/1045486169/eu-wont-recognize-crimea-russia-elections.html\" target=\"_blank\">Sputnik International</a></p>",

                "lead": "President Barack Obama delivered, on Tuesday, his final address to the United Nations General Assembly , calling on leaders to work together and criticizing those who seek a “simple rejection of global integration”. He also accused Russia for the desire to regain its lost glory and insisted that in Syria there can not by a military solution.",
                "Continut": "<p>In the first 45 minutes of his speech, Obama pitied the huge differences between the poorest of the world and the high society. At the same time, the US President reminded about the \"progress\" in the combat against terrorism and to counteract the global crisis effects, pleading for the continuation of the actions towards \"global integration\" and denouncing the inequalities.  </p>\r\n<p>“I do not believe progress is possible if our desire to preserve our identities gives way to an impulse to dehumanize or dominate another group. If our religion leads us to persecute those of another faith, if we jail or beat people who are gay, if our traditions lead us to prevent girls from going to school, if we discriminate on the basis of race or tribe or ethnicity, then the fragile bonds of civilization will fray,” Obama said. “The world is too small, we are too packed together, for us to be able to resort to those old ways of thinking.”</p>\r\n<p>Here are his full remarks from the United Nations headquarters:</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">PRESIDENT OBAMA: Mr. President; Mr. Secretary General; fellow delegates; ladies and gentlemen: As I address this hall as President for the final time, let me recount the progress that we’ve made these last eight years.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">From the depths of the greatest financial crisis of our time, we coordinated our response to avoid further catastrophe and return the global economy to growth. We’ve taken away terrorist safe havens, strengthened the nonproliferation regime, resolved the Iranian nuclear issue through diplomacy. We opened relations with Cuba, helped Colombia end Latin America’s longest warm, and we welcome a democratically elected leader of Myanmar to this Assembly. Our assistance is helping people feed themselves, care for the sick, power communities across Africa, and promote models of development rather than dependence. And we have made international institutions like the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund more representative, while establishing a framework to protect our planet from the ravages of climate change.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\">This is important work. It has made a real difference in the lives of our people. And it could not have happened had we not worked together. And yet, around the globe we are seeing the same forces of global integration that have made us interdependent also expose deep fault lines in the existing international order.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\">We see it in the headlines every day. Around the world, refugees flow across borders in flight from brutal conflict. Financial disruptions continue to weigh upon our workers and entire communities. Across vast swaths of the Middle East, basic security, basic order has broken down. We see too many governments muzzling journalists, and quashing dissent, and censoring the flow of information. Terrorist networks use social media to prey upon the minds of our youth, endangering open societies and spurring anger against innocent immigrants and Muslims. Powerful nations contest the constraints placed on them by international law.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\">This is the paradox that defines our world today. A quarter century after the end of the Cold War, the world is by many measures less violent and more prosperous than ever before, and yet our societies are filled with uncertainty, and unease, and strife. Despite enormous progress, as people lose trust in institutions, governing becomes more difficult and tensions between nations become more quick to surface.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\">And so I believe that at this moment we all face a choice. We can choose to press forward with a better model of cooperation and integration. Or we can retreat into a world sharply divided, and ultimately in conflict, along age-old lines of nation and tribe and race and religion.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\">I want to suggest to you today that we must go forward, and not backward. I believe that as imperfect as they are, the principles of open markets and accountable governance, of democracy and human rights and international law that we have forged remain the firmest foundation for human progress in this century. I make this argument not based on theory or ideology, but on facts — facts that all too often, we forget in the immediacy of current events.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\">Here’s the most important fact: The integration of our global economy has made life better for billions of men, women and children. Over the last 25 years, the number of people living in extreme poverty has been cut from nearly 40 percent of humanity to under 10 percent. That’s unprecedented. And it’s not an abstraction. It means children have enough to eat; mothers don’t die in childbirth.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\">Meanwhile, cracking the genetic code promises to cure diseases that have plagued us for centuries. The Internet can deliver the entirety of human knowledge to a young girl in a remote village on a single hand-held device. In medicine and in manufacturing, in education and communications, we’re experiencing a transformation of how human beings live on a scale that recalls the revolutions in agriculture and industry. And as a result, a person born today is more likely to be healthy, to live longer, and to have access to opportunity than at any time in human history.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\">Moreover, the collapse of colonialism and communism has allowed more people than ever before to live with the freedom to choose their leaders. Despite the real and troubling areas where freedom appears in retreat, the fact remains that the number of democracies around the world has nearly doubled in the last 25 years.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\">In remote corners of the world, citizens are demanding respect for the dignity of all people no matter their gender, or race, or religion, or disability, or sexual orientation, and those who deny others dignity are subject to public reproach. An explosion of social media has given ordinary people more ways to express themselves, and has raised people’s expectations for those of us in power. Indeed, our international order has been so successful that we take it as a given that great powers no longer fight world wars; that the end of the Cold War lifted the shadow of nuclear Armageddon; that the battlefields of Europe have been replaced by peaceful union; that China and India remain on a path of remarkable growth.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\">I say all this not to whitewash the challenges we face, or to suggest complacency. Rather, I believe that we need to acknowledge these achievements in order to summon the confidence to carry this progress forward and to make sure that we do not abandon those very things that have delivered this progress.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\">In order to move forward, though, we do have to acknowledge that the existing path to global integration requires a course correction. As too often, those trumpeting the benefits of globalization have ignored inequality within and among nations; have ignored the enduring appeal of ethnic and sectarian identities; have left international institutions ill-equipped, underfunded, under-resourced, in order to handle transnational challenges.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\">And as these real problems have been neglected, alternative visions of the world have pressed forward both in the wealthiest countries and in the poorest: Religious fundamentalism; the politics of ethnicity, or tribe, or sect; aggressive nationalism; a crude populism — sometimes from the far left, but more often from the far right — which seeks to restore what they believe was a better, simpler age free of outside contamination.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\">We cannot dismiss these visions. They are powerful. They reflect dissatisfaction among too many of our citizens. I do not believe those visions can deliver security or prosperity over the long term, but I do believe that these visions fail to recognize, at a very basic level, our common humanity. Moreover, I believe that the acceleration of travel and technology and telecommunications — together with a global economy that depends on a global supply chain — makes it self-defeating ultimately for those who seek to reverse this progress. Today, a nation ringed by walls would only imprison itself.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\">So the answer cannot be a simple rejection of global integration. Instead, we must work together to make sure the benefits of such integration are broadly shared, and that the disruptions — economic, political, and cultural — that are caused by integration are squarely addressed. This is not the place for a detailed policy blueprint, but let me offer in broad strokes those areas where I believe we must do better together.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\">It starts with making the global economy work better for all people and not just for those at the top. While open markets, capitalism have raised standards of living around the globe, globalization combined with rapid progress and technology has also weakened the position of workers and their ability to secure a decent wage. In advanced economies like my own, unions have been undermined, and many manufacturing jobs have disappeared. Often, those who benefit most from globalization have used their political power to further undermine the position of workers.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\">In developing countries, labor organizations have often been suppressed, and the growth of the middle class has been held back by corruption and underinvestment. Mercantilist policies pursued by governments with export-driven models threaten to undermine the consensus that underpins global trade. And meanwhile, global capital is too often unaccountable — nearly $8 trillion stashed away in tax havens, a shadow banking system that grows beyond the reach of effective oversight.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\">A world in which one percent of humanity controls as much wealth as the other 99 percent will never be stable. I understand that the gaps between rich and poor are not new, but just as the child in a slum today can see the skyscraper nearby, technology now allows any person with a smartphone to see how the most privileged among us live and the contrast between their own lives and others. Expectations rise, then, faster than governments can deliver, and a pervasive sense of injustice undermine people’s faith in the system.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\">So how do we fix this imbalance? We cannot unwind integration any more than we can stuff technology back into a box. Nor can we look to failed models of the past. If we start resorting to trade wars, market distorting subsidies, beggar thy neighbor policies, an overreliance on natural resources instead of innovation — these approaches will make us poorer, collectively, and they are more like to lead to conflict. And the stark contrast between, say, the success of the Republic of Korea and the wasteland of North Korea shows that central, planned control of the economy is a dead end.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\">But I do believe there’s another path — one that fuels growth and innovation, and offers the clearest route to individual opportunity and national success. It does not require succumbing to a soulless capitalism that benefits only the few, but rather recognizes that economies are more successful when we close the gap between rich and poor, and growth is broadly based. And that means respecting the rights of workers so they can organize into independent unions and earn a living wage. It means investing in our people — their skills, their education, their capacity to take an idea and turn it into a business. It means strengthening the safety net that protects our people from hardship and allows them to take more risks — to look for a new job, or start a new venture.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\">These are the policies that I’ve pursued here in the United States, and with clear results. American businesses have created now 15 million new jobs. After the recession, the top one percent of Americans were capturing more than 90 percent of income growth. But today, that’s down to about half. Last year, poverty in this country fell at the fastest rate in nearly 50 years. And with further investment in infrastructure and early childhood education and basic research, I’m confident that such progress will continue.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\">So just as I’ve pursued these measures here at home, so has the United States worked with many nations to curb the excesses of capitalism — not to punish wealth, but to prevent repeated crises that can destroy it. That’s why we’ve worked with other nations to create higher and clearer standards for banking and taxation — because a society that asks less of oligarchs than ordinary citizens will rot from within. That’s why we’ve pushed for transparency and cooperation in rooting out corruption, and tracking illicit dollars, because markets create more jobs when they’re fueled by hard work, and not the capacity to extort a bribe. That’s why we’ve worked to reach trade agreements that raise labor standards and raise environmental standards, as we’ve done with the Trans-Pacific Partnership, so that the benefits are more broadly shared.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\">And just as we benefit by combatting inequality within our countries, I believe advanced economies still need to do more to close the gap between rich and poor nations around the globe. This is difficult politically. It’s difficult to spend on foreign assistance. But I do not believe this is charity. For the small fraction of what we spent at war in Iraq we could support institutions so that fragile states don’t collapse in the first place, and invest in emerging economies that become markets for our goods. It’s not just the right thing to do, it’s the smart thing to do.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\">And that’s why we need to follow through on our efforts to combat climate change. If we don’t act boldly, the bill that could come due will be mass migrations, and cities submerged and nations displaced, and food supplies decimated, and conflicts born of despair. The Paris Agreement gives us a framework to act, but only if we scale up our ambition. And there must be a sense of urgency about bringing the agreement into force, and helping poorer countries leapfrog destructive forms of energy.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\">So, for the wealthiest countries, a Green Climate Fund should only be the beginning. We need to invest in research and provide market incentives to develop new technologies, and then make these technologies accessible and affordable for poorer countries. And only then can we continue lifting all people up from poverty without condemning our children to a planet beyond their capacity to repair.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\">So we need new models for the global marketplace, models that are inclusive and sustainable. And in the same way, we need models of governance that are inclusive and accountable to ordinary people.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\">I recognize not every country in this hall is going to follow the same model of governance. I do not think that America can — or should — impose our system of government on other countries. But there appears to be growing contest between authoritarianism and liberalism right now. And I want everybody to understand, I am not neutral in that contest. I believe in a liberal political order — an order built not just through elections and representative government, but also through respect for human rights and civil society, and independent judiciaries and the rule of law.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\">I know that some countries, which now recognize the power of free markets, still reject the model of free societies. And perhaps those of us who have been promoting democracy feel somewhat discouraged since the end of the Cold War, because we’ve learned that liberal democracy will not just wash across the globe in a single wave. It turns out building accountable institutions is hard work — the work of generations. The gains are often fragile. Sometimes we take one step forward and then two steps back. In countries held together by borders drawn by colonial powers, with ethnic enclaves and tribal divisions, politics and elections can sometimes appear to be a zero-sum game. And so, given the difficulty in forging true democracy in the face of these pressures, it’s no surprise that some argue the future favors the strongman, a top-down model, rather than strong, democratic institutions.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\">But I believe this thinking is wrong. I believe the road of true democracy remains the better path. I believe that in the 21st century, economies can only grow to a certain point until they need to open up — because entrepreneurs need to access information in order to invent; young people need a global education in order to thrive; independent media needs to check the abuses of power. Without this evolution, ultimately expectations of people will not be met; suppression and stagnation will set in. And history shows that strongmen are then left with two paths — permanent crackdown, which sparks strife at home, or scapegoating enemies abroad, which can lead to war.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\">Now, I will admit, my belief that governments serve the individual, and not the other way around, is shaped by America’s story. Our nation began with a promise of freedom that applied only to the few. But because of our democratic Constitution, because of our Bill of Rights, because of our ideals, ordinary people were able to organize, and march, and protest, and ultimately, those ideals won out — opened doors for women and minorities and workers in ways that made our economy more productive and turned our diversity into a strength; that gave innovators the chance to transform every area of human endeavor; that made it possible for someone like me to be elected President of the United States.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\">So, yes, my views are shaped by the specific experiences of America, but I do not think this story is unique to America. Look at the transformation that’s taken place in countries as different as Japan and Chile, Indonesia, Botswana. The countries that have succeeded are ones in which people feel they have a stake.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\">In Europe, the progress of those countries in the former Soviet bloc that embraced democracy stand in clear contrast to those that did not. After all, the people of Ukraine did not take to the streets because of some plot imposed from abroad. They took to the streets because their leadership was for sale and they had no recourse. They demanded change because they saw life get better for people in the Baltics and in Poland, societies that were more liberal, and democratic, and open than their own.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\">So those of us who believe in democracy, we need to speak out forcefully, because both the facts and history, I believe, are on our side. That doesn’t mean democracies are without flaws. It does mean that the cure for what ails our democracies is greater engagement by our citizens — not less.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\">Yes, in America, there is too much money in politics; too much entrenched partisanship; too little participation by citizens, in part because of a patchwork of laws that makes it harder to vote. In Europe, a well-intentioned Brussels often became too isolated from the normal push and pull of national politics. Too often, in capitals, decision-makers have forgotten that democracy needs to be driven by civic engagement from the bottom up, not governance by experts from the top down. And so these are real problems, and as leaders of democratic governments make the case for democracy abroad, we better strive harder to set a better example at home.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\">Moreover, every country will organize its government informed by centuries of history, and the circumstances of geography, and the deeply held beliefs of its people. So I recognize a traditional society may value unity and cohesion more than a diverse country like my own, which was founded upon what, at the time, was a radical idea — the idea of the liberty of individual human beings endowed with certain God-given rights. But that does not mean that ordinary people in Asia, or Africa, or the Middle East somehow prefer arbitrary rule that denies them a voice in the decisions that can shape their lives. I believe that spirit is universal. And if any of you doubt the universality of that desire, listen to the voices of young people everywhere who call out for freedom, and dignity, and the opportunity to control their own lives.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\">This leads me to the third thing we need to do: We must reject any forms of fundamentalism, or racism, or a belief in ethnic superiority that makes our traditional identities irreconcilable with modernity. Instead we need to embrace the tolerance that results from respect of all human beings.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\">It’s a truism that global integration has led to a collision of cultures; trade, migration, the Internet, all these things can challenge and unsettle our most cherished identities. We see liberal societies express opposition when women choose to cover themselves. We see protests responding to Western newspaper cartoons that caricature the Prophet Muhammad. In a world that left the age of empire behind, we see Russia attempting to recover lost glory through force. Asian powers debate competing claims of history. And in Europe and the United States, you see people wrestle with concerns about immigration and changing demographics, and suggesting that somehow people who look different are corrupting the character of our countries.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\">Now, there’s no easy answer for resolving all these social forces, and we must respect the meaning that people draw from their own traditions — from their religion, from their ethnicity, from their sense of nationhood. But I do not believe progress is possible if our desire to preserve our identities gives way to an impulse to dehumanize or dominate another group. If our religion leads us to persecute those of another faith, if we jail or beat people who are gay, if our traditions lead us to prevent girls from going to school, if we discriminate on the basis of race or tribe or ethnicity, then the fragile bonds of civilization will fray. The world is too small, we are too packed together, for us to be able to resort to those old ways of thinking.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\">We see this mindset in too many parts of the Middle East. There, so much of the collapse in order has been fueled because leaders sought legitimacy not because of policies or programs but by resorting to persecuting political opposition, or demonizing other religious sects, by narrowing the public space to the mosque, where in too many places perversions of a great faith were tolerated. These forces built up for years, and are now at work helping to fuel both Syria’s tragic civil war and the mindless, medieval menace of ISIL.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\">The mindset of sectarianism, and extremism, and bloodletting, and retribution that has been taking place will not be quickly reversed. And if we are honest, we understand that no external power is going to be able to force different religious communities or ethnic communities to co-exist for long. But I do believe we have to be honest about the nature of these conflicts, and our international community must continue to work with those who seek to build rather than to destroy.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\">And there is a military component to that. It means being united and relentless in destroying networks like ISIL, which show no respect for human life. But it also means that in a place like Syria, where there’s no ultimate military victory to be won, we’re going to have to pursue the hard work of diplomacy that aims to stop the violence, and deliver aid to those in need, and support those who pursue a political settlement and can see those who are not like themselves as worthy of dignity and respect.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\">Across the region’s conflicts, we have to insist that all parties recognize a common humanity and that nations end proxy wars that fuel disorder. Because until basic questions are answered about how communities co-exist, the embers of extremism will continue to burn, countless human beings will suffer — most of all in that region — but extremism will continue to be exported overseas. And the world is too small for us to simply be able to build a wall and prevent it from affecting our own societies.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\">And what is true in the Middle East is true for all of us. Surely, religious traditions can be honored and upheld while teaching young people science and math, rather than intolerance. Surely, we can sustain our unique traditions while giving women their full and rightful role in the politics and economics of a nation. Surely, we can rally our nations to solidarity while recognizing equal treatment for all communities — whether it’s a religious minority in Myanmar, or an ethnic minority in Burundi, or a racial minority right here in the United States. And surely, Israelis and Palestinians will be better off if Palestinians reject incitement and recognize the legitimacy of Israel, but Israel recognizes that it cannot permanently occupy and settle Palestinian land. We all have to do better as leaders in tamping down, rather than encouraging, a notion of identity that leads us to diminish others.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\">And this leads me to the fourth and final thing we need to do, and that is sustain our commitment to international cooperation rooted in the rights and responsibilities of nations.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\">As President of the United States, I know that for most of human history, power has not been unipolar. The end of the Cold War may have led too many to forget this truth. I’ve noticed as President that at times, both America’s adversaries and some of our allies believe that all problems were either caused by Washington or could be solved by Washington — and perhaps too many in Washington believed that as well. (Laughter.) But I believe America has been a rare superpower in human history insofar as it has been willing to think beyond narrow self-interest; that while we’ve made our share of mistakes over these last 25 years — and I’ve acknowledged some — we have strived, sometimes at great sacrifice, to align better our actions with our ideals. And as a consequence, I believe we have been a force for good.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\">We have secured allies. We’ve acted to protect the vulnerable. We supported human rights and welcomed scrutiny of our own actions. We’ve bound our power to international laws and institutions. When we’ve made mistakes, we’ve tried to acknowledge them. We have worked to roll back poverty and hunger and disease beyond our borders, not just within our borders.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\">I’m proud of that. But I also know that we can’t do this alone. And I believe that if we’re to meet the challenges of this century, we are all going to have to do more to build up international capacity. We cannot escape the prospect of nuclear war unless we all commit to stopping the spread of nuclear weapons and pursuing a world without them.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\">When Iran agrees to accept constraints on its nuclear program that enhances global security and enhances Iran’s ability to work with other nations. On the other hand, when North Korea tests a bomb that endangers all of us. And any country that breaks this basic bargain must face consequences. And those nations with these weapons, like the United States, have a unique responsibility to pursue the path of reducing our stockpiles, and reaffirming basic norms like the commitment to never test them again.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\">We can’t combat a disease like Zika that recognizes no borders — mosquitos don’t respect walls — unless we make permanent the same urgency that we brought to bear against Ebola — by strengthening our own systems of public health, by investing in cures and rolling back the root causes of disease, and helping poorer countries develop a public health infrastructure.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\">We can only eliminate extreme poverty if the sustainable development goals that we have set are more than words on paper. Human ingenuity now gives us the capacity to feed the hungry and give all of our children — including our girls — the education that is the foundation for opportunity in our world. But we have to put our money where our mouths are.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\">And we can only realize the promise of this institution’s founding — to replace the ravages of war with cooperation — if powerful nations like my own accept constraints. Sometimes I’m criticized in my own country for professing a belief in international norms and multilateral institutions. But I am convinced that in the long run, giving up some freedom of action — not giving up our ability to protect ourselves or pursue our core interests, but binding ourselves to international rules over the long term — enhances our security. And I think that’s not just true for us.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\">If Russia continues to interfere in the affairs of its neighbors, it may be popular at home, it may fuel nationalist fervor for a time, but over time it is also going to diminish its stature and make its borders less secure. In the South China Sea, a peaceful resolution of disputes offered by law will mean far greater stability than the militarization of a few rocks and reefs.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\">We are all stakeholders in this international system, and it calls upon all of us to invest in the success of institutions to which we belong. And the good news is, is that many nations have shown what kind of progress is possible when we make those commitments. Consider what we’ve accomplished here over the past few years.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\">Together, we mobilized some 50,000 additional troops for U.N. peacekeeping, making them nimble, better equipped, better prepared to deal with emergencies. Together, we established an Open Government Partnership so that, increasingly, transparency empowers more and more people around the globe. And together, now, we have to open our hearts and do more to help refugees who are desperate for a home.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\">We should all welcome the pledges of increased assistance that have been made at this General Assembly gathering. I’ll be discussing that more this afternoon. But we have to follow through, even when the politics are hard. Because in the eyes of innocent men and women and children who, through no fault of their own, have had to flee everything that they know, everything that they love, we have to have the empathy to see ourselves. We have to imagine what it would be like for our family, for our children, if the unspeakable happened to us. And we should all understand that, ultimately, our world will be more secure if we are prepared to help those in need and the nations who are carrying the largest burden with respect to accommodating these refugees.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\">There are a lot of nations right now that are doing the right thing. But many nations — particularly those blessed with wealth and the benefits of geography — that can do more to offer a hand, even if they also insist that refugees who come to our countries have to do more to adapt to the customs and conventions of the communities that are now providing them a home.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\">Let me conclude by saying that I recognize history tells a different story than the one that I’ve talked about here today. There’s a much darker and more cynical view of history that we can adopt. Human beings are too often motivated by greed and by power. Big countries for most of history have pushed smaller ones around. Tribes and ethnic groups and nation states have very often found it most convenient to define themselves by what they hate and not just those ideas that bind them together.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\">Time and again, human beings have believed that they finally arrived at a period of enlightenment only to repeat, then, cycles of conflict and suffering. Perhaps that’s our fate. We have to remember that the choices of individual human beings led to repeated world war. But we also have to remember that the choices of individual human beings created a United Nations, so that a war like that would never happen again. Each of us as leaders, each nation can choose to reject those who appeal to our worst impulses and embrace those who appeal to our best. For we have shown that we can choose a better history.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\">Sitting in a prison cell, a young Martin Luther King, Jr. wrote that, “Human progress never rolls on the wheels of inevitability; it comes through the tireless efforts of men willing to be co-workers with God.” And during the course of these eight years, as I’ve traveled to many of your nations, I have seen that spirit in our young people, who are more educated and more tolerant, and more inclusive and more diverse, and more creative than our generation; who are more empathetic and compassionate towards their fellow human beings than previous generations. And, yes, some of that comes with the idealism of youth. But it also comes with young people’s access to information about other peoples and places — an understanding unique in human history that their future is bound with the fates of other human beings on the other side of the world.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\">I think of the thousands of health care workers from around the world who volunteered to fight Ebola. I remember the young entrepreneurs I met who are now starting new businesses in Cuba, the parliamentarians who used to be just a few years ago political prisoners in Myanmar. I think of the girls who have braved taunts or violence just to go to school in Afghanistan, and the university students who started programs online to reject the extremism of organizations like ISIL. I draw strength from the young Americans — entrepreneurs, activists, soldiers, new citizens — who are remaking our nation once again, who are unconstrained by old habits and old conventions, and unencumbered by what is, but are instead ready to seize what ought to be.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\">My own family is a made up of the flesh and blood and traditions and cultures and faiths from a lot of different parts of the world — just as America has been built by immigrants from every shore. And in my own life, in this country, and as President, I have learned that our identities do not have to be defined by putting someone else down, but can be enhanced by lifting somebody else up. They don’t have to be defined in opposition to others, but rather by a belief in liberty and equality and justice and fairness.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\">And the embrace of these principles as universal doesn’t weaken my particular pride, my particular love for America — it strengthens it. My belief that these ideals apply everywhere doesn’t lessen my commitment to help those who look like me, or pray as I do, or pledge allegiance to my flag. But my faith in those principles does force me to expand my moral imagination and to recognize that I can best serve my own people, I can best look after my own daughters, by making sure that my actions seek what is right for all people and all children, and your daughters and your sons.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\">This is what I believe: that all of us can be co-workers with God. And our leadership, and our governments, and this United Nations should reflect this irreducible truth.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p2\">Thank you very much. (Applause.)</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/EIw9B_7QkGA\" width=\"740\" height=\"350\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe> </p>\r\n<p>Source: <a href=\"http://time.com/4501910/president-obama-united-nations-speech-transcript/\" target=\"_blank\">time.com</a></p>",

                "Continut": "<p>The company said it believes a \"state-sponsored actor\" was behind the data breach, meaning an individual acting on behalf of a government. The breach is said to have occurred in late 2014.</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p><em>\"The account information may have included names, email addresses, telephone numbers, dates of birth, hashed passwords (the vast majority with bcrypt) and, in some cases, encrypted or unencrypted security questions and answers,\"</em> Yahoo said in a <a href=\"https://yahoo.tumblr.com/post/150781911849/an-important-message-about-yahoo-user-security\" target=\"_blank\">statement</a>.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>Yahoo urges users to change their password and security questions and to review their accounts for suspicious activity.</p>\r\n<p>The silver lining for users - if there is one - is that sensitive financial data like bank account numbers and credit card data are not believed to be included in the stolen information, according to Yahoo.</p>\r\n<p>Yahoo says it is working with law enforcement on the breach.</p>\r\n<p>A large-scale data breach was first rumored in August when a hacker who goes by the name of \"Peace\" claimed to be selling data from 200 million Yahoo users online. The same hacker has previously claimed to sell stolen accounts from LinkedIn (<a class=\"inlink\" href=\"http://money.cnn.com/quote/quote.html?symb=LNKD&amp;source=story_quote_link\">LNKD</a>, <a href=\"http://money.cnn.com/technology/tech30/index.html?iid=EL\">Tech30</a>) and MySpace.</p>\r\n<p>Yahoo originally said it was \"aware of a claim\" and was investigating the situation. Nearly two months later, it turns out the situation is even worse.</p>\r\n<p>The data breach comes at a sensitive time for Yahoo.</p>\r\n<p>Verizon (<a class=\"inlink\" href=\"http://money.cnn.com/quote/quote.html?symb=VZ&amp;source=story_quote_link\">VZ</a>, <a href=\"http://money.cnn.com/technology/tech30/index.html?iid=EL\">Tech30</a>) agreed to buy Yahoo's core properties for $4.83 billion in late July, just days before the hack was first reported. The deal is expected to close in the first quarter of 2017.</p>\r\n<p>Verizon says it only learned of the breach this week.</p>\r\n<p>\"Within the last two days, we were notified of Yahoo's security incident,\" a spokesperon for Verizon said in a statement provided to CNNMoney.</p>\r\n<p>We understand Yahoo is conducting an active investigation of this matter, but we otherwise have limited information and understanding of the impact.\"</p>\r\n<p>The mega-breach could create a headache for both companies, including damaging press, scrutiny from regulators and a user exodus, just as they're working to close the deal and figure out the future of Yahoo.</p>\r\n<p>Source: <a href=\"http://money.cnn.com/2016/09/22/technology/yahoo-data-breach/\" target=\"_blank\">CNN Money</a></p>",

A local commander of the militant Al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP), known as Abu Khaled al-Sanaani, was killed along with three associates, they said.</p>\r\n<p>It was the second drone strike in two days to target a local commander of the Islamist militant group regarded by U.S. officials as one of the most dangerous branches of al Qaeda.</p>\r\n<p>A drone strike on a vehicle in al-Bayda province in central Yemen killed a senior AQAP leader known as Abdallah al-Sanaani, identified as a regional commander of the group, on Thursday.</p>\r\n<p>The United States has been using drones to target the Islamist militant group which has exploited Yemen's civil war to carve out a foothold in the impoverished country. Several leaders of the group have been killed by drone strikes in recent years.</p>\r\n<p>U.S. officials have said AQAP is one of the most potent security threats in the Middle East. The group, whose attacks have mainly targeted the Yemeni government and the Iran-allied Houthi group, claimed responsibility for an attack last year on the Paris office of the French satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo.</p>\r\n<p>Source: <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-yemen-security-alqaeda-idUSKCN11U06E?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=topNews&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=Social\" target=\"_blank\">Reuters.com</a></p>",

Osipov previously commanded a paratrooper unit of Russian army in Anapa</p>\r\n<p>The Interior Ministry of Ukraine revealed the details on the murdered in Luhansk Russian colonel. As Ministry's speaker Artem Shevchenko wrote on Facebook, Deputy Commander of Kremlin-sponsored ‘2nd Army Corps' of the puppet state ‘Luhansk Peoples Republic' Alexander Osipov  (nicknamed ‘Orlov') previously served as a paratrooper commander in a Russian army unit in Anapa (Krasnodarsk region, Caucasus, Russia). </p>\r\n<p>\"<em>Paratrooper, really big bump. He could serve way along in Anapa, now he is dead in separatists showdown in our land. Suicide of the \"premier-minister\" Tsypkalov – seems to be logical part of the same case</em>,\"<strong> Shevchenko says in his statement</strong>.</p>\r\n<p>Open sources say, that in the town of Anapa the base of Guards Artillery Regiment №1141 is placed. This unit is a part of 7th Airborne Assault Division of Russian Army. According to Ukrainian volunteers, units of this division took part in Russian invasion to Ukrainian Donbas in 2014 and 2015, in particular - during the battle of Ilovaysk.</p>\r\n<p>Earlier Ukrainian Military Intel informed of <strong>Russian high-ranking official killed in Donbas</strong>. Kremlin' Secret Service started an investigation of his death is militant-held Ukrainian Luhansk. Also yesterday an information appeared on ex-Luhansk 'Prime Minister' - he was <strong>arrested by separatists, then allegedly 'committed suicide'</strong>. </p>",

                "lead": "European Union leaders will explore next month the possibility of improving strained ties with Russia in response to growing irritation among some member states over economic sanctions imposed on Moscow over its role in the Ukraine crisis.",
                "Continut": "<p>However the sanctions appear likely to remain in place for now, especially those slapped over Crimea, the Black Sea peninsula seized by Russia in March 2014, despite the legal and political challenges of maintaining them. EU leaders will review the state of relations with Russia at a summit on Oct. 20-21, with the hawks' camp weakened by Britain's decision to leave the bloc and by increased strains between Brussels and Poland's nationalist-minded government.</p>\r\n<p>Countries skeptical about extending sanctions include Italy, Greece, Cyprus, Slovakia and Hungary. They are keen to return to doing business with Russia, the EU's main gas supplier, not least to help offset Europe's sluggish economic growth.</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p><em>\"It will be increasingly difficult to go on extending the sanctions. But this could be done if the key skeptics are convinced that there are other elements in the EU's policy on Russia, not just sanctions,\"</em> said a senior EU official.</p>\r\n<p><em>\"There will be those who want to lower the bar for Russia, give a signal that if only Moscow makes a little move, the EU would want to normalize the situation a bit. Then there will be those who want to raise the bar. Eventually we'll stay more or less where we are. The advantage of those who want easing is that you need unanimity to extend sanctions. But no one wants to be alone in blocking (an extension). It would be different if a few of them came out together,\"</em> a second EU official said.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>The EU first imposed sanctions after Russia seized Crimea following a Western-backed uprising against a pro-Russian leader in Kiev. It then widened the sanctions over Moscow's backing for rebels battling Kiev's forces in eastern Ukraine in a conflict that has killed more than 9,500 people since April 2014.</p>\r\n<p>The sanctions include travel bans and asset freezes on people and entities; curbs on energy, financial and defense dealings with Russia and limits on doing business in Crimea.</p>\r\n<p>Source: <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-ukraine-crisis-eu-russia-idUSKCN11W17P\" target=\"_blank\">Reuters</a></p>",

The stakes were high as the candidates headed into the debate tied in most national polls ahead of the November 8 election.</p>\r\n<p><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" src=\"http://www.agerpres.ro/media/images/2016-09/09270445565353546.jpg\" alt=\"\" align=\"center\" border=\"0\" /></p>\r\n<p>The first topic discussed was job creation, with the candidates being asked how they would make American manufacturers bring back production to the US.</p>\r\n<p>The debate heated up as the rivals discussed the NAFTA trade deal.</p>\r\n<p>Off topic while still debating under the banner \"Achieving Prosperity\", Trump mocked Clinton for spelling out on her website how she would fight ISIL. \"At least I have a plan,\" Clinton countered.</p>\r\n<p><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" src=\"http://www.agerpres.ro/media/images/2016-09/09270442565192546.jpg\" alt=\"\" align=\"center\" border=\"0\" /></p>\r\n<p>The candidates also hit out at each other over issues that have plagued their campaigns: for Trump, his refusal to release his tax returns, and for Clinton, controversy over the use of a private email server during her time as secretary of state.</p>\r\n<p>Trump said as soon as Clinton releases 33,000 emails, \"I will release my tax returns\".</p>\r\n<p><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" src=\"http://www.agerpres.ro/media/images/2016-09/09270444565269546.jpg\" alt=\"\" align=\"center\" border=\"0\" /></p>\r\n<p>Moving on to the second topic of the night, \"America's Direction\", and how to heal America's racial divide, Clinton said \"race still determines how people are treated in the US criminal justice system\".</p>\r\n<p>The issue has caused heated debate in the US and was again put in the spotlight last week after deadly police shootings of black men in Charlotte and Tulsa.</p>\r\n<p>Trump used his opening segment on the same issue to stress the importance of \"law and order\", and praised the stop-and-frisk policy - which was struck down by a New York judge and widely deemed a form or racial profiling. </p>\r\n<p><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" src=\"http://www.agerpres.ro/media/images/2016-09/09270451565747843.jpg\" alt=\"\" align=\"center\" border=\"0\" /></p>\r\n<p>Trump used his opening segment on the same issue to stress the importance of \"law and order\", and praised the stop-and-frisk policy - which was struck down by a New York judge and widely deemed a form or racial profiling. </p>\r\n<p>When he was pressed about what he would say to people offended by his years of questioning whether President Barack Obama was born in the US, Trump did not respond directly, instead praising himself for forcing Obama to produce his birth certificate. </p>\r\n<p>The third topic chosen by the Presidential Debate Commission for Monday's showdown at Hofstra University was \"Securing America\".</p>\r\n<p>Getting back to discussing the fight against the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL, or ISIS) and clashing with Clinton over the Iraq War, Trump said \"we should have taken the oil\". He went on to say that if that had happened, ISIL would not have been able to form as oil is a main source of income for the group, which has taken territory in Syria and Iraq. </p>\r\n<p><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" src=\"http://www.agerpres.ro/media/images/2016-09/09270509566821468.jpg\" alt=\"\" align=\"center\" border=\"0\" /></p>\r\n<p>Trump, known for fiery statements on the campaign trail, later stated that he has \"a winning temperament\", leading Clinton to give off a big smile before discussing the US-Iran nuclear deal.</p>\r\n<p>She scored laughter from the audience as she said Trump was too easily provoked to serve as commander- in-chief.</p>\r\n<p>\"A man who can be provoked by a tweet should not have his fingers anywhere near the nuclear codes,\" she said.</p>\r\n<p><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" src=\"http://www.agerpres.ro/media/images/2016-09/09270510566854828.jpg\" alt=\"\" align=\"center\" border=\"0\" /></p>\r\n<p>Trump's popularity had been rising in the lead-up to the debate. </p>\r\n<p>Quinnipiac University declared the race \"too close to call\" on Monday, with its latest national poll of likely voters suggesting 47 percent support for Clinton and 46 percent for Trump.</p>\r\n<p>\"It really felt great,\" Trump told reporters after the debate.</p>\r\n<p><img style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" src=\"http://www.agerpres.ro/media/images/2016-09/09270553569441437.jpg\" alt=\"\" align=\"center\" border=\"0\" /></p>\r\n<p>But political analyst Jason Johnson told Al Jazeera that he would not be surprised \"if we see slight chances in the polls at the end of the week \" in favour of Clinton.</p>\r\n<p>\"Trump came out aggressively ... but never offered much in terms of substance or answers,\" he said.</p>\r\n<p>\"I think Hillary did what she needed to do better than Trump. She offered solutions.. explained how she sees America and her worldview. Her supporters will come out very enthusiastic.\" </p>\r\n<p>It was the first time the two candidates stood side by side since becoming their parties' nominees.</p>\r\n<p>Two more debates are to follow on October 9 and October 19.</p>\r\n<p><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZEHPrYUcoi0\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></p>\r\n<p>Source: <a href=\"http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2016/09/presidential-debate-hillary-clinton-donald-trump-160926224000516.html\" target=\"_blank\">Al Jazeera News</a></p>\r\n<p><strong><br /></strong></p>",

All of them died in that accident.</p>\r\n<p>Different investigations showed that the plane was hit by a BUK type missile, launched from the territory under the control of the Donbas separatists.    </p>\r\n<p>In July, the Security Council of UN voted a resolution regarding the inauguration of the International Court of Justice for the crashing of the Boeing, but Russia blocked this decision, invoking its veto.</p>\r\n<p>In July 2015, the victims families took proceedings against one of the separatist military men, Igor Strelkov. He is accused of organisation of shooting down the plane and demand compensation of 900 millions dollars.  </p>",

Romania will stay on top of the European economic growth ranking in 2017, when will register a 3.8 percent advance of the GDP (the same as Iceland), according to the last report \"World Economic Outlook,\" released on Tuesday.",
                "Continut": "<p>Romania's economic growth in 2016 is above that of Ireland, which last year had a record advance of 26.3%, compared to an increase of 3.8% registered by Romania. In addition, the IMF estimations for 2016 expect a negative inflation of minus 1.5%, a current account deficit of 2% from GDP and an unemployment rate of 6.4%, that decreased by 0.4 points in regard to 2015.</p>\r\n<p>National Statistics Institute Data showed a GDP growth of 6% in Q2 year/year, and 5.2% in S1 in relation to S1 2015. Therefore, most analysts and institutions that are doing macroeconomic researches have revised upwards the economic growth forecasts. Thus, if Romania's budget is built on an economic growth of 4.1%, most analysts estimate a growth to 5%  this year, the IMF is one of the last institutions, which increased its forecasts upwards.</p>\r\n<p>For the next year, according to the Washington-based institution, growth will lower to 3.8%. In the April report, IMF estimation of growth was of 4.2% for Romania.</p>\r\n<div id=\"adoceanthinkdigitalromijicwksei\">Acoording to the report \"World Economic Outlook\" published yesterday by IMF, Romania will register an economic growth of 5%, while the average in Europe will be 2%. The emerging Europe, area which also includes Romania, will register a GDP advance of 3.3%. In the ranking of economic growth on the continent after Romania is Ireland, with an economic growth of 4.9% in 2016 (plus 26.3% in 2015).</div>\r\n<p>In regard to 2017, the IMF forecast is that GDP growth will be 3.8%. However, it is a better forecast than the April one - 3.6%. In addition, this growth for Romania would be the strongest in the EU (3.8% of growth also recorded in the mentioned forecast only Iceland). On average, the EU will increase in 2017 by 1.8% and \"emerging Europe\" by 3.1%.</p>\r\n<p>In respect to the inflation, the IMF estimations for 2016 have been revised from minus 0.4 percent in April to minus 1.5 percent. However, from 2017 the inflation will return to plus: 1.7 percent.  </p>\r\n<p>Regarding the current account deficit, it would be 2 percent of GDP in 2016, towards 1.7 percent, as estimated the institution in April report.</p>\r\n<p>The current account deficit will get steeper next year, when it is expected to reach minus 2.8 percent, from minus 2.5 percent as estimated in Spring.</p>\r\n<p>The unemployment rate would be 6.4 percent in 2016 and 6.2 percent in 2017.</p>\r\n<p>The IMF has kept its spring forecasts on the world economy growth: 3.1 percent in 2016 and 3.4 percent 2017.</p>",

The head of the Russian MMA Union, Fedor Emelianenko, has led the wave of criticism against the event, and Kadyrov in particular, labeling the children’s participation “unacceptable.” The Kremlin declared that those fights should become a cause for a check of the supervisory authorities.",
                "Continut": "<p>The \"Akhmat\" children's martial arts tournament was held in Grozny, Chechnya on October 4 on the eve of Chechen President Ramzan Kadyrov's birthday. Three of the children were sons of Chechen leader Ramzan Kadyrov - 10-year-old Akhmad, 9-year-old Zelimkhan and 8-year-old Adam. Akhmad knocked out another boy on Tuesday in front of his father and a packed arena in Chechnya and won the “youth division” in 14 seconds. <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BLJ4lTiAtZI/\" target=\"_blank\">Eli Kadyrov</a> and <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BLJ9XAFAMLB/\" target=\"_blank\">Adam Kadyrov</a> also won their bouts, the latter trading blows and grappling with his opponent before throwing him to the ground.</p>\r\n<p><iframe src=\"https://www.facebook.com/plugins/video.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2FRKadyrov95%2Fvideos%2F1159151207453843%2F&amp;show_text=0&amp;width=560\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" style=\"border: none; overflow: hidden;\" allowfullscreen=\"true\"></iframe></p>\r\n<p>After the matches, which were broadcast by an MMA television channel, the brothers posed with huge gold title belts.</p>\r\n<p>Kadyrov gushed about the fights on Instagram, but Russia’s most famous fighter and MMA union head, Fedor Emelianenko, called them “inexcusable”, saying MMA rules did not allow children under 12 to compete. He also noted that the boys were not wearing helmets or protective vests, and said fights held according to adult rules could harm children physically and psychologically.</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p><em>\"Children under 12 aren’t even allowed into the hall as spectators, but here kids who are eight years old were beating each other up in front of delighted adults. Is it really that important for everyone to organise a spectacle at the expense of children’s health?”</em> Emelianenko wrote on his own Instagram.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>In line with the regulations of the Russian MMA Union, only children of age over 12 can be allowed taking part in the fights. Participants within the age groups of 12-13, 14-15 and 16-17 are obliged to wear rash guards (an athletic shirt made of spandex and nylon or polyester) and protective ammunitions.</p>\r\n<p>President Vladimir Putin’s spokesman <a class=\"u-underline\" href=\"http://www.interfax.ru/russia/531346\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">told</a> journalists that the “knockout of a child, especially on television, is a reason for the appropriate oversight agencies to get involved”. The sports ministry <a class=\"u-underline\" href=\"http://tass.com/sport/904448\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">told</a> the news agency Tass that it would open an inquiry into the fights.</p>\r\n<p>Sports Minister Vitaly Mutko said it was high time to discuss this issue as well as the issue regarding illegal formats of competitions in the country.</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p><em>\"I think it is about time to raise this issue,\"</em> he said. <em>\"There must not be a tournament in Russia if it does not comply with any officially registered sport. We need to return to this issue once again considering the fact that this format (of MMA fighting) has age limitations.\"</em></p>\r\n<p><em>\"In line with MMA regulations, children can take up this sport starting with a certain age, not to mention entering competitions,\"</em> the sports minister added.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>Several Chechen officials responded to Emelianenko with insults and accusations. Timur Dugazayev, Kadyrov’s representative in Europe and general director of the leader’s Akhmat MMA promotion, <a class=\"u-underline\" href=\"http://tass.ru/sport/3681698\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">said</a>: “Fedor should look at the situation from a man’s point of view.”</p>\r\n<p>MP Adam Delimkhanov, a relative of Kadyrov, <a class=\"u-underline\" href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/BLN5qMyhAKf/?taken-by=delimkhanov95\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">said</a> it was “strange to hear such words” from a fighter who “stole a win” after “losing shamefully and being harshly beaten” in his controversial June decision over Fábio Maldonado. Valid Edilov, director of the Akhmat fight club, <a class=\"u-underline\" href=\"http://tass.ru/sport/3682933\" data-link-name=\"in body link\">accused</a> Emelianenko of doping and argued that fighting was part of Chechen children’s upbringing.</p>\r\n<p> \n\t\t\t<div class=\"cs_img \"  style=\"width:610px;\">\n\t\t\t <p><a href=\"/images/cms-image-000002357.jpg\" class=\"photoViewer\" title=\"\"> \t\t\t\t<img src=\"/get_img?ImageWidth=610&amp;ImageHeight=576&amp;ImageId=2357\"   border=\"0\"/>\n\t\t\t </a></p> \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\n</p>\r\n<p>\n\t\t\t<div class=\"cs_img \"  style=\"width:610px;\">\n\t\t\t <p><a href=\"/images/cms-image-000002358.jpg\" class=\"photoViewer\" title=\"\"> \t\t\t\t<img src=\"/get_img?ImageWidth=610&amp;ImageHeight=555&amp;ImageId=2358\"   border=\"0\"/>\n\t\t\t </a></p> \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\n</p>\r\n<p>\n\t\t\t<div class=\"cs_img \"  style=\"width:610px;\">\n\t\t\t <p><a href=\"/images/cms-image-000002359.jpg\" class=\"photoViewer\" title=\"\"> \t\t\t\t<img src=\"/get_img?ImageWidth=610&amp;ImageHeight=712&amp;ImageId=2359\"   border=\"0\"/>\n\t\t\t </a></p> \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\n<br /><br /></p>",

There are numerous photographs of public stunts in support of Putin, such as Russians holding letters reading \"Happy birthday Vladimir\", and the \"I Will Rip It for Putin\" <a href=\"http://echo.msk.ru/blog/varlamov_i/795838-echo/\">rally</a> at which young women tore off sleeveless undershirts with the president’s face pictured in pink.</p>\r\n<p>Viktor Levanov, editor of the pro-Kremlin news site Gosindex, told journalists at a photo studio in downtown Moscow that the birthday book was meant to look at how Putin had <em>\"stepped outside the boundaries of personality and became a worldwide cultural phenomenon\".</em></p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p><em><em>\"The use of his image in art, literature and journalism can’t not be noticed. Even the presidential campaign in the United States <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/08/trump-putin-senate-republicans-marco-rubio-john-mccain\">has recently been unfolding</a>around how candidates relate to Vladimir Putin,\"</em> he said.</em></p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p><em>\n\t\t\t<div class=\"cs_img \"  style=\"width:675px;\">\n\t\t\t <p><a href=\"/images/cms-image-000002426.jpg\" class=\"photoViewer\" title=\"Authors of the book In the Lead Role: Putin in Contemporary Culture.\"> \t\t\t\t<img src=\"/get_img?ImageWidth=675&amp;ImageHeight=461&amp;ImageId=2426\" alt=\"Authors of the book In the Lead Role: Putin in Contemporary Culture.\" title=\"Authors of the book In the Lead Role: Putin in Contemporary Culture.\"  border=\"0\"/>\n\t\t\t </a></p> \t\t\t                                    <p class=\"cs_img_caption\">Authors of the book In the Lead Role: Putin in Contemporary Culture.</p>\n                            \t\t</div>\n\t\n</em></p>\r\n<p>Levanov, who made his name as a LiveJournal blogger, said the book had not received state funding and the profits would go to an Amur tiger centre started by Putin. He said it was not a political statement and denied that a cult of personality was forming around Putin.</p>\r\n<p>But he admitted the authors had gathered material from pro-Kremlin youth movements backed by the state and said he liked the fact that such groups had <em>\"done a lot to promote Putin’s image\"</em>. Levanov said he would send a copy of the book to the president.</p>\r\n<p>\n\t\t\t<div class=\"cs_img \"  style=\"width:675px;\">\n\t\t\t <p><a href=\"/images/cms-image-000002428.jpg\" class=\"photoViewer\" title=\"Pages of the book In the Lead Role: Putin in Contemporary Culture.\"> \t\t\t\t<img src=\"/get_img?ImageWidth=675&amp;ImageHeight=451&amp;ImageId=2428\" alt=\"Pages of the book In the Lead Role: Putin in Contemporary Culture.\" title=\"Pages of the book In the Lead Role: Putin in Contemporary Culture.\"  border=\"0\"/>\n\t\t\t </a></p> \t\t\t                                    <p class=\"cs_img_caption\">Pages of the book In the Lead Role: Putin in Contemporary Culture.</p>\n                            \t\t</div>\n\t\n</p>\r\n<p>The book features examples of the western media’s supposed distortion of Putin’s image. The New Tsar, a book by the New York Times correspondent Steven Lee Myers, <em>\"is supposed to be complete and truthful; however, already from the cover it’s clear that the author was not able to avoid stereotypes,\"</em> the authors write. On another page, an issue of Der Spiegel depicting Putin standing above David Cameron, Angela Merkel and Barack Obama is called a <em>\"classic of European demonisation\"</em>.</p>\r\n<p>\n\t\t\t<div class=\"cs_img \"  style=\"width:675px;\">\n\t\t\t <p><a href=\"/images/cms-image-000002435.jpg\" class=\"photoViewer\" title=\"Pages of the book In the Lead Role: Putin in Contemporary Culture\"> \t\t\t\t<img src=\"/get_img?ImageWidth=675&amp;ImageHeight=338&amp;ImageId=2435\" alt=\"Pages of the book In the Lead Role: Putin in Contemporary Culture\" title=\"Pages of the book In the Lead Role: Putin in Contemporary Culture\"  border=\"0\"/>\n\t\t\t </a></p> \t\t\t                                    <p class=\"cs_img_caption\">Pages of the book In the Lead Role: Putin in Contemporary Culture</p>\n                            \t\t</div>\n\t\n</p>\r\n<p>Among those attending the presentation was the head of the Putin Facebook fan club, Mikhail Antonov, who had helped with the book. For Putin’s 62nd birthday, in 2014, he organised an exhibition of paintings <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/oct/06/vladimir-putin-hercules-art-exhibition\">reimagining</a> the president’s achievements as the 12 Labours of Hercules.</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p><em>\"As we say, a spoon is good before lunch. It’s our president’s birthday, and we want to bring people together who are interested in Putin,\"</em> Antonov said.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>Source: <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/oct/07/book-celebrates-vladimir-putin-as-cultural-phenomenon-russia-birthday\" target=\"_blank\">Guardian</a></p>",

                "Continut": "<p>Guterres, 67, will replace Ban Ki-moon, 72, of South Korea. Ban will step down at the end of 2016 after serving two five terms. Guterres was Portugal's prime minister from 1995 to 2002 and U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees from 2005 to 2015.</p>\r\n<p>Guterres pledged on Thursday to act as an \"honest broker\" and said he would take a humble approach in trying to deal with global issues, with human dignity at the core of his work.</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p><em>\"Diversity can bring us together, not drive us apart,\"</em> Guterres told the General Assembly.</p>\r\n<p><em>\"We must make sure that we are able to break this alliance between all those terrorist groups or violent extremists on one side and the expressions of populism and xenophobia on the other side,\"</em> he said.</p>\r\n<p><em>\"These two reinforce each other, and we must be able to fight both of them with determination.\"</em></p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>The 15-member U.N. Security Council last week unanimously recommended that the General Assembly appoint Guterres. He beat out 12 other candidates, seven of whom were women, amid a push for the first woman to be elected.</p>\r\n<p>Guterres told the General Assembly that protection and empowerment of women and girls was a priority commitment. He has pledged to work toward gender parity within the United Nations.</p>\r\n<p>\"We have selected a candidate who is prepared to cut past the jargon and the acronyms and the sterile briefings and get real,\" U.S. Ambassador Samantha Power told the General Assembly. \"He knows the only measure of our work here is whether we are or are not helping and supporting real people.\"</p>\r\n<p>Diplomats were now watching to see who Guterres appoints to senior U.N. positions amid speculation by diplomats and U.N. officials that China would like one of its nationals to head peacekeeping and that Russia is keen to lead political affairs.</p>\r\n<p>Currently, a French man runs peacekeeping, an American man leads political affairs and a British man is in charge of humanitarian affairs.</p>\r\n<p>A senior U.N. Security Council diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity, said several people had insisted that Guterres did not do any deals to win Russia and China's votes.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>Source: <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-un-election-idUSKCN12D215?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=worldNews\" target=\"_blank\">Reuters</a></p>",

He’ll know it and it will be at the time of our choosing and under the circumstances that have the greatest impact.”</em></p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>Asked whether the public will know, Biden responded tersely: <em>“I hope not.”</em></p>\r\n<p>Officials have in the past said any cyber-attacks on important US institutions would prompt a response, which could take the form of diplomatic or economic sanctions, or possibly cyber measures.</p>\r\n<p>NBC later reported that the CIA was preparing a retaliatory cyber-attack <em>“designed to harass and ’embarrass’ the Kremlin leadership.”</em></p>\r\n<p>A joint statement from the Department of Homeland Security and Office of the Director of National Intelligence was the first official accusation by Washington against Moscow in a spate of email hacks.</p>\r\n<p>Source: <a href=\"http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/825564/biden-were-sending-a-message-to-putin\" target=\"_blank\">inquirer.net</a></p>\r\n<p><br /><br /><br /></p>",

                "Continut": "<p>At the 11th hour in 2016 Romania’s entry, Ovidiu Anton was disqualified from competing in the song contest for 2016. That was due to TVR owing extensive debts to the EBU, and being unable to pay them off ahead of the competition: which requires a member be ‘in good standing’.</p>\r\n<p>Since then TVR and the EBU have settled their financial disagreements, with TVR repaying their debts and the EBU welcoming them back to membership. Part of that return has included free consultancy work from EBU for TVR in an effort to avoid the issues happening further again.</p>\r\n<p>There are a remaining 10-million euros to be paid on the debt and TVR announced as part of their Eurovision announcement that they will be paying that over three years. TVR seems to have undergone something of a renaissance after the budget crisis which saw them disqualified in 2016.</p>\r\n<p>This announcement did not contain any details on how a national selection would work for Romania, but that they will competing at all reflects a phenomenal turnaround for TVR. Historically TVR has gone with a selection show, but given that 2016 saw them disqualified due to financial issues, they could very well go with an internal selection for financial reasons.</p>\r\n<p>Source: <a href=\"http://www.axs.com/romania-will-make-eurovision-return-in-2017-108270\" target=\"_blank\">axs.com</a></p>\r\n<p>\n\t\t\t<div class=\"cs_img \"  style=\"width:540px;\">\n\t\t\t <p><a href=\"/images/cms-image-000002835.png\" class=\"photoViewer\" title=\"\"> \t\t\t\t<img src=\"/get_img?ImageWidth=540&amp;ImageHeight=798&amp;ImageId=2835\"   border=\"0\"/>\n\t\t\t </a></p> \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\n</p>",

It is a small separatist region recognised by Russia, announced on Monday the so-called Abkhazian Minister of Internal Affairs, cited by the news agency RIA Novosti, according to AFP.",

Conducted operational work. Work of all power structures of Abkhazia\",</em> states the alleged Minister of Internal Affairs, Aslan Kobakhia, reports Agerpres.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>According to him the explosion occurred around 7:05 a.m. The identity of the bomber remains unknown.</p>\r\n<p>Interfax news cited the separatist region’s emergency services ministry as saying the “corpse of a bearded man” was found at the scene.</p>\r\n<p>Abkhazia has claimed independence from Georgia since an armed conflict in the early 1990s after the collapse of the Soviet Union. Russia recognised the region as independent from Georgia following a brief conflict in 2008 over another breakaway region of South Ossetia and has thousands of troops stationed there. Georgia insists that the two regions are under de facto Russian occupation.</p>",

                "lead": "RT editor-in-chief Margarita Simonyan tweeted that all the company's accounts in the UK have been blocked.",
                "Continut": "<blockquote>\r\n<p><em>\"They've closed our accounts in Britain. All our accounts. 'The decision is not subject to review.' Praise be to freedom of speech!\"</em> wrote Simonian. </p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>In a conversation with RBC, Simonian stated that the decision is not surprising. She noted that the reason for freezing its accounts is unknown, but admitted it might be associated with new sanctions.</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p><em>\"We have no idea of the reason, because neither yesterday nor the day before, or weeks ago there was nothing different happened to us and there were no threats to us. Perhaps, but this is only our assumption, because we are waiting for the announcement of new British and American sanctions. Perhaps this is the explanation. Now our lawyers are trying to determine the cause of the problem,\"</em> - stated the RT editor.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>A point of view expressed also the spokesman of the Russian Foreign Ministry. Maria Zakharova said that RT blocked accounts in the UK suggests that \"London has left Europe, forgetting about all its obligations under the freedom of expression,\" according to RIA Novosti.</p>\r\n<p>Earlier, Ofcom, the UK regulator authority in the audiovisual zone, accused RT of bias regarding the coverage of Cuadrilla company business, specializing in shale gas. Ofcom has recorded 15 violations on audiovisual laws during RT transmissions and started an investigation against Russian propaganda TV station.</p>\r\n<p>Before that, in 2014, the UK regulator authority found violations professional ethics of RT in the coverage topics related to the crisis in Ukraine. In particular, the channel has been accused of the presented events exclusively from the position of Russian authorities in Ukraine.</p>\r\n<p>Source: <a href=\"http://www.paginaderusia.ro/londra-a-blocat-toate-conturile-canalului-rt-din-marea-britanie/\" target=\"_blank\">Paginaderusia</a></p>",

                "Continut": "<p>For example, in the town of Pyt-Yakh, where elections are to be held on October 21, the voters still do not know the names of the candidates for the office of mayor. The admission committee said, to <a href=\"https://www.znak.com/2016-10-17/v_yugre_po_zakonu_o_personalnyh_dannyh_zasekretili_familii_kandidatov_v_mery_gorodov\"><em>znak.com</em></a> that it has received documents from four candidates for mayor, but none of them wanted to make their name public. \"All we can say is that they registered four candidates. All of them asked to remain anonymous, indicating this thing in their applications. The procedure for submission of documents will last until October 19,\" stated the officials from electoral commission. </p>\r\n<p>A similar situation is observed in the neighboring town Nefteyugansk, where the period of submission of documents ended on October 15. Half of those who enrolled in the electoral commission asked not to be disclosed their identity. The press, however, learned the names of candidates.  </p>\r\n<p>In Nizhnevartovsk, where these days is conducted the registration process in the electoral race, are now registered nine candidates for mayor position of the city. These nine candidates as well asked not to be disclosed their identity.</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p><em>\"We understand the absurdity of this story and the fact that is inconsistent with slogans about the transparency of the electoral process, declaimed by Kremlin. For us it is a paradox when a person applies for participation in an open electoral contest for mayor of a big city and at the same time, wants to remain incognito. Probably the candidate does not want anyone to know about his plans seize on the power until he will win\",</em> stated a member of the election commission.</p>\r\n</blockquote>",

The document presents the subversive strategy of the Russian Federation in Ukraine, that forms a clear and complete picture of the way in which is made the hybrid warfare tactics. The document demonstrates how cynically achieves its geopolitical goals the Russian Federation in the region and how thorough are developed the implementation phases of the subversive activities.",
                "Continut": "<p>The document is entitled <a href=\"http://lb.ua/news/2016/10/24/348732_hakeri_vilozhili_plan_surkova.html\" target=\"_blank\">Primary action plan to destabilize the social and political situation in Ukraine \"Shatun\"</a> (A species of bear - n.r.). The main objective of the actions is to organize early elections, parliamentary and presidential elections in Ukraine. The document was published by the website <a href=\"http://lb.ua/news/2016/10/24/348732_hakeri_vilozhili_plan_surkova.html\" target=\"_blank\">lb.ua</a> with reference to the Ukrainian hacker site <a href=\"http://cyberhunta.com/news/kiberhunta-peredaet-privet-surkovu/\" target=\"_blank\">cyberhunta.com</a></p>\r\n<p>The Spokesman of Vladimir Putin, Dmitry Peskov, has not denied, nor confirmed the information on breaking Vladislav Surkov's e-mail. Pesckov gave an evasive answer to the journalists, stating that Voladislav Surkov is a man so talented, that hackers always try to ascribe certain things to him, which often do not correspond to the reality, it is said in the statement of Peskov, quoted by <a href=\"http://tass.ru/politika/3731755\">Tass</a>. </p>\r\n<p>We note that Vladislav Surkov, the adviser to Putin, attended the negotiations in Normand Format at Berlin regarding the implementation of the Minsk agreements. At the beginning of 2014, Surkov was a secret diplomat in Kiev, where he gathered information on the Maidan. Surkov is one of those who was at the bases of the establishment of the separatist projects in Eastern Ukraine.    </p>\r\n<p>First of all, in the documents disclosed publily it is about the negotiations with opposition parties. The Ukrainian hacker organization \"KinerHunta\", stated that it broked the electronic mail of Vladislav Surkov, the Russian President's advisor.</p>\r\n<p>The documents were posted on the website \"KiberHunta\". The achievement of the plan is the period November 2016 - March 2017. </p>\r\n<p>The document states that Transcarpathia would be destabilized through the neighboring states, including Romania. The Ruthenian minorities in Hungary, Slovakia and Romania would be the key to this plan, reads the document, they will be mobilized to demand the end of the conflict in Ukraine and the recognition of the Ruthenian autonomy from Transcarpathia.</p>\r\n<p><strong>The Maidan of prices</strong></p>\r\n<p>In the document it is said that Ukraine is a presidential and parliamentary type of state, that's why it is necessary that in these two institutions will enter political forces, whose leaders support the peaceful resolution of the conflict in Donbas. This is the fact that will give Russia a chance to manipulate those forces. \"It is possible that Donbas to be returned to Ukraine, with the assumption of the imposed conditions by the Russian Federation, which, in turn, will allow the entry into the Ukrainian parliament of the persons loyal to Russia and adopting, as such, the requisite legislation. In perspective, this means the probability to influence Ukraine and block the EU integration and cooperation with the NATO,\" it is shown in the document.</p>\r\n<p>Among the actions that will be realized by Russia in Ukraine are found the negotiations with opposition parties - \"Oppoblok\", Batkivshcina, the right wing extreme Party of Leashko - but also with some MPs. The subject of discussion should be the activization og the protest movement in the context of the start of the heating season. \"The prices of Maidan\" is expected to begin in the second half of November, after what the population will receive the bills for the heat.</p>\r\n<p>The biggest stake is the opposition Party \"Baktivshcina\" which has an image of a fighter with the prices. At the same time, the organizers take into account the experience of a nefarious organization of a Maidan of the tariffs in Kiev, that's why they emphasize on the achievement of a material and financial base for providing these Maidan’s in regional centers and major cities from the southeast. That will \"tie\" the region cops, without the ability to move to the center, where will be held a large anti-government protest. At the same time, it is expected to be supported and other protests that will be organized by various political powers in Ukraine.</p>\r\n<p><strong>The most important directions regarding the destabilizing of the public opinion </strong></p>\r\n<p>It is pursiating the discreditation of the social-economic policies, promoted by the Government and the President, the local authorities, on the background of  the economic problems: utility tariffs, decreasing the standard of living, the collapse of the system of subsidies, the poor state of medicine and education, the reforms on paper, the unemployment, the mass emigration, the ecology, the rights of national minorities in Transcarpathia, Bukovina, Southern Ukraine. The deadline: November 2016.</p>\r\n<p>In the document it is said about the development of some false video and audio materials, of some conversations, phone messages, capture of the conversations from the social networks, the correspondence that will \"uncover\" corruption acts of Poroshenko and people from his entourage. It is also talking about the achieving and lobbying organisation for business. It is planed and the conducting of some investigations on corruption acts committed by Poroshenko's team. In this sense, it is expect to be addressed the anti-corruption journalists (Shabunin, Bigus, Gnap, Dubinskii, Shalaiskii). \"The information must be true, complete and be propagated by our sources from abroad - Europe and the US\", reads the document. At the same time it is expected to be brought into public attention the corruption scandals from the past.</p>\r\n<p>The document also states the intention to adopt certain changes in the Constitution, to provide a particular economic status to the areas: choosing governors, the allocation of financial resources, minimizing the influence of Kiev on the economic and social situation, tariff autonomy, free economic zones in Odessa, Dnepropetrovsk, Lvov, Zaporozhye, Harkov etc.   </p>\r\n<p>Another direction of destabilization of the situation will be raising crime in Kiev and other cities. Will speculate police inefficiency will be organized raider attacks, religious strifes, with the involvement of so-called \"battalions of volunteers\". It is expected to be carried out a lobbying campaign for the law on the sale of land, \"so the people would have stolen property.\" It is also mentioned the criticism of the project on rising the retirement age to 65 years.</p>\r\n<p>It is also talking about the infiltration of men \"needed\" in voluntary movement and the Armed Forces of Ukraine, aiming the influencing the inside of these structures and dissemination of information about \"abandoning\" the Ukrainian military men by the power that ensure their civil existence without shortcomings, while those soldiers are dying in the trenches, block-posts, and the families of those killed on the front are left without any social support. The purpose of these actions is, obviously, the growing of \"abandonment\" sense among soldiers and volunteers. This will activate the movement of protest, involving of the paramilitary and nationalist organizations in Kiev and regions. This will also put emphasis on Poroshenko's inability to stop the casualties during the operations in Donbas. Deadline: October to December 2016.</p>\r\n<p><strong>The propaganda information </strong></p>\r\n<p>Negotiations with politicians and big business representatives, are to be held, who have certain levers in the Verkhovna Rada. The topic of discussion will be the economical support from the Russian state for businesses and politicians, but also about media in Ukraine and Russia, including in the electoral period. Deadline: the end of November 2016.</p>\r\n<p>In parallel, it is aiming a formation of some operational groups, that will be used during a large-scale demonstrations and the realization of some actions against the protesters, under the identity of police authorities loyal to the government. The goal would be the discreditation: of both, the power, and of the respective structures. That shall be done by recruiting athletes and criminal elements, under the banner of the ruling party and of the nationalist structures. Another possibility to initiate a confrontation would be some marches of the Cross, where believers will bear the portraits of Nicholas II, St. George ribbons and other irritating attributes. Deadline: the end of November.</p>\r\n<p>However, is to be expected the activation of public organizations of national minorities in Ukraine, including Russia, with the aim of popularizing the idea of peaceful coexistence of the fraternal peoples, of the culture, of the history and mutual traditions. The banners will be: \"The country needs peace,\" \"Let's not fight, it's time to create.\" Deadline: throughout the period.  </p>\r\n<p>Throughout the implementation of the plan it will be pursued the realization of some public hearings, televised bridges, interviews and reports in Ukrainian media, with the involvement of politicians with leadership and activists servants, to instill to the public opinion the idea of inability of authorities in Ukraine to cope the main objectives: economic growth and welfare. An activation of social networks is to be expected: virtual groups, social initiatives. A particular attention should be paid to the claims of EU and the US politicians: the most materials have to start with the exact words of these politicians and not by the statements of the Russian politicians.</p>\r\n<p><strong>A separate section is dedicated to the discreditiation of President Poroshenko.</strong></p>\r\n<p>Another section is dedicated to the creation of a false republic in Transcarpathia and is called \"The concrete action plan on implementation of the federal statute of Transcarpathian region of Ukraine.\" This plan involves organizing of the work in diverse social, political and regional structure, with the contribution of the peak authorities in the region.</p>\r\n<p>A phase in the implementation of this plan will be the activation of the \"Rusinskaia Rodina\" group - left-wing of the Rusyns community. In particular, the group aims to increase the number to 1,000 members. Thus, by the end of July, is to be recruited 200 people, and by the mid-August, another 800. However, is expected to be create cells, each with its own leader, of the noted group in the districts of Transcarpathia: Uzhhorod in particular, Mukacev, Hust. In each of these places must be as 100 members each. And in the districts – 50-70 members each.</p>\r\n<p>Based on these structures, mobile groups for the implementation of actions with subversive character must be formed. In total, is to be conducted four such mobile groups.</p>\r\n<p><iframe src=\"http://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/key/8yFJKb6DnOSID1\" width=\"668\" height=\"714\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" marginheight=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" style=\"border: 1px solid #CCC; border-width: 1px; margin-bottom: 5px; max-width: 100%;\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></p>\r\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 5px;\"><strong> <a title=\"File 1\" href=\"http://www.slideshare.net/apizniuk/file-1-67578536\" target=\"_blank\">File 1</a> </strong> from <strong><a href=\"http://www.slideshare.net/apizniuk\" target=\"_blank\">Андрій Пізнюк</a></strong></div>\r\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 5px;\"> </div>\r\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 5px;\"><iframe src=\"http://www.slideshare.net/slideshow/embed_code/key/xML3sqKMT1KvRf\" width=\"668\" height=\"714\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" marginheight=\"0\" marginwidth=\"0\" style=\"border: 1px solid #CCC; border-width: 1px; margin-bottom: 5px; max-width: 100%;\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe>\r\n<div style=\"margin-bottom: 5px;\"><strong> <a title=\"File 2\" href=\"http://www.slideshare.net/apizniuk/file-2-67578581\" target=\"_blank\">File 2</a> </strong> from <strong><a href=\"http://www.slideshare.net/apizniuk\" target=\"_blank\">Андрій Пізнюк</a></strong></div>\r\n</div>",

During that period, 78 of the 213 journalists killed (36.5%) were in Arab States.</p>\r\n<p>Perhaps most alarming was the increase in journalist deaths in Western Europe and North America, up from none in 2014 to 11 last year.</p>\r\n<p>Local journalists are far more at risk than foreign journalists, accounting for 90% of the victims. But there was a huge spike in foreign journalist deaths in 2014 with 17 killed compared to an average of four in previous years.</p>\r\n<p>Last year saw a massive increase in online journalists being killed, with 21 compared to two in 2014. Almost half of those were Syrian bloggers.</p>\r\n<p>The report found that more than 10 times as many men are killed than women -195 to 18 in 2014/15 - while television journalists have overtaken print hacks as the most vulnerable.</p>\r\n<p>The report noted that death is not the only harm journalists are exposed to.</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p><em>\"The extent of the risks faced by journalists is demonstrated by the 827 killings recorded by UNESCO over the course of ten years,\"</em> said the report. </p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>The report was requested by 39 member states of UNESCO's Intergovernmental Council.</p>",

The OSCE did not inspect the vehicle. The border crossing on the Ukrainian side - Dovzhansky - is currently controlled by the separatist rebels. In Kiev, Ukrainian security spokesman Andriy Lysenko said that five vehicles \"belonging to the Rostov funeral service\" had crossed the border on Tuesday. He alleged that they had transported \"Russian military men\".</p>\r\n<p>Ukraine and the West accuse Russia of sending its soldiers to fight with separatist rebels in eastern Ukraine. The Kremlin denies the allegations. More than 4,000 people have died in the conflict between Ukraine's military and pro-Russian rebels in the eastern Donetsk and Luhansk regions.</p>\r\n<p>Nearly a million people have fled their homes since the fighting started in April, a month after Russia annexed Ukraine's southern Crimea peninsula. The violence in the east has continued despite a ceasefire deal struck in Minsk, Belarus, in September, with both sides accusing each other of shelling and other violations of the agreement. </p>\r\n<p>Ukraine has repeatedly stated that a number of Russia's regularly troops have been killed in fighting in the Donetsk and Luhansk regions. Moscow denies the allegations as propaganda, but admits that what it describes as \"Russian volunteers\" are fighting alongside the rebels.</p>\r\n<p>Source: <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-30039004\" target=\"_blank\">BBC</a></p>",

                "lead": "Hundreds of thousands of NATO troops will be put on a higher state of alert amid growing tensions with Russia, the head of the alliance has indicated.",
                "Continut": "<p>NATO commanders want to prepare a substantial land force capable of deterring Russian ­aggression.</p>\r\n<p>NATO secretary-general Jens Stoltenberg did not give precise figures, but Adam Thomson, Britain’s outgoing permanent representative to the alliance, said the goal was to speed up the response time of up to 300,000 military personnel to about two months. At present a force of this size could take up to 180 days to deploy.</p>\r\n<p>The troops would act as a ­“follow-on force” to NATO’s existing response force, which can be deployed to a war zone within days. The personnel will come from nations across the alliance.</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p><em>“We have seen Russia being much more active in many ­different ways. We have seen a more assertive Russia implementing a substantial military build-up over many years; tripling defence spending since 2000 in real terms; developing new military capabilities; exercising their forces and using military force against neighbours. We have also seen Russia using propaganda in Europe among NATO allies and that is exactly the reason why NATO is responding. We are responding with the biggest reinforcement of our collective defence since the end of the Cold War,”</em> Mr Stoltenbergsaid in an exclusive interview.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>The measures, drawn up after Russian President Vladimir Putin’s annexation of Crimea in 2014 and the conflict in east Ukraine, include the deployment of 4000 NATO troops to Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and Poland from next year. NATO has already created an emergency response force of 5000 ground troops, backed by air, sea and special forces, which is able to mobilise within five days.</p>\r\n<p>In addition, the 28 member states agreed to triple the size of an incumbent response force to 40,000 troops. They can be moved in quickly as reinforcements after the initial wave.</p>\r\n<p>Mr Stoltenberg said NATO was looking at improving the readiness of many of the alliance’s three million soldiers, sailors, ­airmen and Marines.</p>\r\n<p><em>“We are ... addressing what we call the follow-on forces,”</em> he said.<em> “There are a large number of people in the armed forces of NATO allies. We are looking into how more of them can be ready on a shorter notice.”</em></p>\r\n<p>The issue was discussed at a meeting of NATO defence ministers last month. Sir Adam said all allies had agreed it was necessary to increase the deployability of large numbers of ­alliance troops. “I am not sure that everyone has realised how difficult and how expensive it is going to be, but it is part of that concept agreed in February of this year,” Sir Adam said, referring to a previous meeting of defence ministers.</p>\r\n<p>After the Soviet Union ­collapsed, defence budgets in most NATO states were slashed. Most of those forces still in uniform were put on a lower state of readiness. But ­Russia continued to train its military at scale, with exercises of more than 100,000 personnel taking place each year. NATO is also responding to an increase in espionage, hybrid warfare and cyber attacks. One step has been the creation of an intelligence division.</p>\r\n<p>Source: <a href=\"http://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/huge-nato-land-army-to-meet-russian-aggression-xsdnldzkq\" target=\"_blank\">The Times</a></p>",

The president cast his ballot last month during early voting in Illinois.</p>\r\n<p>He has played basketball on both election days during his own run for President. The only time he didn’t was when he lost of the New Hampshire primary to Hillary Clinton.</p>\r\n<p>So far, the rigorous compliance of this tradition brought him luck. It remains to be seen whether it will work not only for himself but also for others and if, as Obama wants, Hillary Clinton succeeds in the White House.</p>\r\n<p>Source: <a href=\"http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/nov/8/obama-plays-hoops-early-election-day-joe-biden-vot/\" target=\"_blank\">The Washington Post</a></p>",

Here we must consider the economic side, said a Moldovan politician in a discussion we had, due to the policy of association with the EU and the economic situation happens that many Moldovans who work in the area of Russia get home after becoming unemployed. They get home and wait to find a job, find opportunities, but we here have contributed very little,\" added the head of state.</p>\r\n<p>He reminded that Romania and Moldova have a very special relationship, but pointed out that our country has helped people many times.</p>\r\n<p>\"We analyzed together with those who know what happened in the relationship between Romania and Moldova in 90s onwards, what was done well, what was done wrong. We concluded that our intervention in Moldova was at least ineffective, to not use other words, because some politicians say that I do not appreciate their work. (...) Very often, instead of helping Moldova, institutions, parties, we helped people in Moldova, and sometimes those people had good results, but sometimes they led some ridiculous political projects. We concluded that we must change things. It is wrong to help some people and it is important to help organizations, institutions. It does not make sense to help a person or group to obtain something that maybe for Moldovans is not relevant, but for us it is,\" said Iohannis.</p>\r\n<p>Source: <a href=\"http://www.agerpres.ro/politica/2016/11/09/iohannis-o-unire-cu-basarabia-este-posibila-dar-nu-in-viitorul-apropiat-21-11-10\">Agerpres</a></p>",

Ukraine is a peaceful state, we will defend our territory, but I would like to stress that no Ukrainian military, especially a spy, has been detained by the Russian special services,\" he said.</p>\r\n<p>\"It is clear that they will target someone, plant some explosives on them and say that they are 'Ukrainian saboteurs'.

Peskov also dismissed the ICC's accusations of an \"armed conflict\" in Crimea, arguing that Crimea joined Russia after a legitimate popular vote.</p>\r\n<p>Russia's foreign ministry insisted in a statement that Russia wants everyone implicated in grave international crimes to face justice but expressed frustration over the court's work in recent years.</p>\r\n<p>\"The court has unfortunately failed to match the hopes one had and did not become a truly independent and respected body of international justice,\" the ministry said, adding that in the ICCs' 14 years of work \"only four verdicts\" have been passed while $1 billion was spent on expenses.</p>\r\n<p>Just hours before Russia's announcement, the U.N. human rights chief made a spirited defense of the ICC, entreating countries not to leave it.

                "Continut": "<p>Two of the biggest global ATM manufacturers, NCR and Diebold Nixdorf, said they were aware of the attacks and were working with customers in efforts to mitigate the threat. The targeted countries include Armenia, Belarus, Bulgaria, Estonia, Georgia, Kyrgyzstan, Moldova, the Netherlands, Poland, Romania, Russia, Spain, the United Kingdom, and Malaysia, according to Russian cybersecurity firm Group IB.</p>\r\n<p>Group IB researchers believe that Cobalt is linked to a well-known cybercrime syndicate called Buhtrap, which stole over 1.8m roubles ($28m) from Russian banks between August 2015 and January 2016.</p>\r\n<p>Researchers noted several similarities in the use of tools and techniques between Cobalt and Buhtrap. However, Buhtrap stole money via fraudulent wire transfers and not ATM jackpotting (a term referred to forcing ATMs to spit out cash).</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p><em>\"What we are seeing demonstrated is the new model of organized crime,\"</em> said independent security consultant Shane Shook, who helps banks and governments investigate cyberattacks and reviewed Group IB's findings.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>Earlier in the month, the FBI reportedly sent private alerts to US banks, cautioning them to remain on the lookout for ATM attacks, following the recent high-profile ATM cyberheists.</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p><em>\"We have been working actively with customers, including those who have been impacted, as well as developing proactive security solutions and strategies to help prevent and minimise the impact of these attacks,\"</em> said Owen Wild, NCR's global marketing director for enterprise fraud and security.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>The disclosures about the latest hacking spree follow similar ATM hacks in Taiwan and Thailand, which saw hackers steal over £260,000 from Thailand's Government Savings Bank (GSB).</p>\r\n<p>Source: <a href=\"http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/hacker-group-cobalt-hits-atms-across-europe-1592748\" target=\"_blank\">International Business Times (IBT)</a></p>",

                "Continut": "<p>\"Developing and strengthening the legal status of Russian language in the constitution and in the practice of our neighbors is a priority for us\", <a href=\"http://www.newsru.co.il/world/29nov2016/russian456.html\">news.ru</a> quoted the words of the Russian diplomat.</p>\r\n<p>In CIS countries, the Russian language has the status of \"language of interethnic communication.\" This status has no clear legal interpretation and in the Baltic States, Georgia and Ukraine, Russian lost its status of interethnic communication as a result of state policy.</p>\r\n<p>Russian Foreign Ministry is particularly concerned of the status of Russian language in Latvia and Estonia, where a considerable part of the population speaks Russian, and this is not reflected in the legislation in any way, TASS agency reports.</p>\r\n<p>According to the UN statistics, in 2015, out of 138 million people living in CIS countries (except Russia), Russian is spoken by 61 million people, 36.9 million speak it passively and 35.6 million people do not speak Russian.</p>\r\n<p>MFA of the Russian Federation intends to make special efforts to promote Russian language abroad - says Ambassador Mitrofanova - raising the issue in international forums. Earlier, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov urged the development of Russian schools abroad, stressing that at least 260 million people who speak Russian are in the world.</p>\r\n<p>This initiative has not been greeted enthusiastically by the partner states of the Russian Federation. Minister of Education of Armenia, Levon Mkrtchyan, ruled against changing the status of Russian language in the republic. According to him, the Russian language has the status of a foreign language, and this cannot be changed. \"The state language in Armenia is the Armenian language. Law on Language is one of the core values of our independence and cannot be changed,\" Mkrtchyan said.</p>\r\n<p>Azerbaijan explained vaguely that government policy supports the Russian language even without having adopted a special law. Minister of Education, Mikayil Jabbarov said that \"90,000 students from 340 schools receive education in Russian, and more than 450,000 pupils study Russian language as a foreign language\".</p>\r\n<p>President-elect of the Republic of Moldova, Igor Dodon promised to keep the status of language of interethnic communication for Russian. \"Knowledge of the Russian language for the Moldovans is a big advantage. No matter where the citizen is working - at home, in Italy or Russia. We must keep the Russian language,\" said Dodon.</p>\r\n<p>For the expansion of Russian language in CIS countries, Russia is going to increase the quotas of free education for students from former Soviet states. The most talented of them will receive grants. Schools and universities in the Eurasian space that teach in Russian, will receive textbooks, audio and video materials, scientific literature in Russian. Russian language teachers will be sent in the CIS countries.</p>\r\n<p>This was said by the speaker of the Federation Council, Valentina Matviyenko, within the Integration Club, dedicated to the education issues.</p>",

The Address is an annual event and is traditionally delivered at the Kremlin’s St George Hall where the president gives his speech to members of both houses of the parliament.",
                "Continut": "<p>In his annual state-of-the-nation address, Russian President Vladimir Putin has said that the country is unified like never before and is fully capable of achieving its strategic economic and geopolitical goals.</p>\r\n<p>Although the speech was predominantly about domestic priorities, Putin several times spoke of pressure from outside forces, including the economic sanctions introduced by the United States, European Union, and other countries over Russia's 2014 annexation of Ukraine's Crimea region and Moscow's military support for separatists in eastern Ukraine.</p>\r\n<p>Putin said the sanctions imposed by the West were an \"attempt to make us dance their dance, as people say, and to neglect our national interests.\"</p>\r\n<p><em>\"All instruments have been used, from myths about Russian aggression and propaganda to the persecution of our Olympic athletes,\"</em> Putin said, referring to a major scandal this year that saw many Russian athletes barred from competing in the Summer Olympics in Brazil after a World Anti-Doping Agency report accused Russia of implementing an extensive state-sponsored doping program.</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p><em>\"There have been targeted disinformation campaigns, propaganda, and attempts to mentor us - we are tired of it all,\"</em> Putin said. <em>\"But we are ready to take part in the solution of global problems. We do not seek confrontation with anyone. We are not looking for enemies. We need friends.\"</em></p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>Putin mentioned what he indicated was an opportunity for improved relations with the United States presented by the election of Donald Trump as president. He said Moscow is ready to cooperate with the United States to combat international terrorism, which he described as a <em>\"real, not fictional\"</em> threat.</p>\r\n<p>He also said that Russia's relations with China were a \"stabilizing factor\" in global and regional politics, and are based on \"harmony\" rather than the idea of \"domination\" of the world stage by any particular country - an apparent reference to the United States.</p>\r\n<p>He did not mention Ukraine or any other former Soviet countries and only obliquely referred to the civil war in Syria.</p>\r\n<p>He ordered the government of Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev to develop a strategic plan for bolstering Russia's place in the global economy through 2025.</p>\r\n<p>Moscow-based political analyst Aleksandr Kynev said on Facebook that Putin's speech was the \"quietest, tamest, calmest, most peaceable\" of his state-of-the-nation addresses.</p>\r\n<p>On Twitter, social activist Alyona Popova wryly suggested that the Russia that Putin described in the address was largely imaginary.</p>\r\n<p>Opposition politician and anticorruption activist Aleksei Navalny was more unequivocal. He said Putin's speech \"was completely empty and consisted either of flat-out lies about 'successes' or the same promises we have had for the last 17 years.\"</p>\r\n<p>Source: <a href=\"http://www.rferl.org/a/russia-putin-annual-address/28149799.html\" target=\"_blank\">Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty</a></p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p><strong><em><br /><br /></em></strong></p>\r\n<p><br /><br /></p>",

The declaration was said at a rally in Cincinnati, according to Reuters.",

Engage your brain before you engage your weapon.\"</p>\r\n<p>\"If in order to kill the enemy you have to kill an innocent, don't take the shot. Don't create more enemies than you take out by some immoral act.\"</p>\r\n<p>\"I come in peace. I didn't bring artillery. But I'm pleading with you, with tears in my eyes: If you f--- with me, I'll kill you all.\"</p>\r\n<p>\"Be polite, be professional, but have a plan to kill everybody you meet.\"</p>\r\n<p>\"Find the enemy that wants to end this experiment (in American democracy) and kill every one of them until they're so sick of the killing that they leave us and our freedoms intact.\"</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>Source: <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/trump-has-chosen-retired-marine-gen-james-mattis-for-secretary-of-defense/2016/12/01/6c6b3b74-aff9-11e6-be1c-8cec35b1ad25_story.html?utm_term=.36d2d7ad8a44\" target=\"_blank\">Washington Post</a>, <a href=\"http://www.businessinsider.com/general-mattiss-best-quotes-2016-11/#in-this-age-i-dont-care-how-tactically-or-operationally-brilliant-you-are-if-you-cannot-create-harmony-even-vicious-harmony-on-the-battlefield-based-on-trust-across-service-lines-across-coalition-and-national-lines-and-across-civilianmilitary-lines-you-need-to-go-home-because-your-leadership-is-obsolete-we-have-got-to-have-officers-who-can-create-harmony-across-all-those-lines-14\">Business Insider</a></p>",

                "lead": "Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi is set to resign on Monday after suffering a crushing defeat in a referendum over constitutional reform, tipping the euro zone's third-largest economy into political turmoil.",
                "Continut": "<p>Renzi's emotional, midnight resignation announcement sent the euro lower and jolted stock and bond markets on concerns that early elections could follow, possibly paving the way for an anti-euro party, the 5-Star Movement, to come to power. But financial markets bounced back later in the morning as European officials played down the prospect of a broader euro zone crisis.</p>\r\n<p>Italian Economy Minister Pier Carlo Padoan, who has pulled out of scheduled meetings with European finance ministers in Brussels this week, is viewed as a possible candidate to replace Renzi. Senate President Pietro Grasso and Transport Minister Graziano Delrio have also been tipped as possible successors.</p>\r\n<p>The government crisis could open the door to elections next year and to the possibility of the opposition 5-Star Movement gaining power in the heart of the single currency area. 5-Star, which campaigned hard for a 'No' vote, wants to hold a referendum instead on membership of the euro.</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p><em>\"I take full responsibility for the defeat,\"</em> Renzi said in a televised address to the nation, adding that he would hand in his formal resignation to President Sergio Mattarella on Monday.</p>\r\n<p><em>\"I will greet my successor with a smile and a hug, whoever it might be,\"</em> he said, struggling to contain his emotions when he thanked his wife and children for their support.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>Sunday's referendum was over government plans to reduce the powers of the upper house Senate and regional authorities but was viewed by many people as a chance to register dissatisfaction with Renzi, who has struggled to revive economic growth, and mainstream politics.</p>\r\n<p>Source: <a href=\"http://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-italy-referendum-election-idUKKBN13T06W\" target=\"_blank\">Reuters</a></p>",

The Italians have a lot of experience dealing with such situations and that’s why I’m not concerned,\"</em> German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble told reporters in Brussels before a gathering of his euro-area counterparts.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>Voters in Italy on Sunday rejected by 60 percent to 40 percent Renzi’s proposal to rein in the power of the Senate, triggering fears of renewed financial upheaval in Europe. Even as Italian bond yields rose in response to the referendum, equity markets across the continent showed little sign of panic.</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p><em>\"It doesn’t really change the situation economically in Italy or in the Italian banks. The problems that we have today are the problems we had yesterday and they still have to be dealt with and that process will continue as far as I’m concerned, so let’s wait for the outcome of the political process,\"</em> said Jeroen Dijsselbloem, the Dutch finance minister who chairs meetings of his euro-area counterparts. “”</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>The yield on Italy’s benchmark 10-year bond rose 12 basis points, or 0.12 percentage point, to 2.02 percent at 3:06 p.m. in Rome. That’s up from a closing low this year of 1.1 percent on Aug. 12. The FTSE MIB index, which tracks the 40 most liquid stocks in Italy, fell 1.2 percent.</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p><em>\"Italy is a solid country that is anchored in European construction. All of this won’t have an impact on our determination to face European difficulties,\"</em> French Finance Minister Michel Sapin said.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>The euro pared its earlier losses against the dollar, rising 0.4 percent to $1.07. Italy’s Finance Minister Pier Carlo Padoan, a potential successor to Renzi, canceled his trip to Brussels for the meeting.</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p><em>\"Italy is a strong country, it’s a reliable country. I’m confident the Italian authorities have the means and the capacity to face this situation,\"</em> European Union Economic and Monetary Commissioner Pierre Moscovici said.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>Source: <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-12-05/shocks-from-italy-vote-limited-say-euro-area-finance-ministers\" target=\"_blank\">Bloomberg</a></p>",

                "Continut": "<p>Until it was shut down this summer, the sham embassy was housed in a run-down, pink two-storey building with a corrugated iron roof and flew a U.S. flag outside. Inside hung a portrait of President Barack Obama.</p>\r\n<p><em>\"It was not operated by the United States government, but by figures from both Ghanaian and Turkish organized crime rings and a Ghanaian attorney practicing immigration and criminal law,\"</em> the State Department said in a statement released late on Friday.</p>\r\n<p>Turkish citizens, who spoke English and Dutch, posed as consular officers and staffed the operation. Investigations also uncovered a fake Dutch embassy, the State Department said. Officials in the Netherlands were not immediately reachable for comment.</p>\r\n<p>The crime ring issued fraudulently obtained but legitimate U.S. visas and false identification documents, including birth certificates at a cost of $6,000 each, the statement said.</p>\r\n<p>During raids that led to a number of arrests, authorities also seized authentic and counterfeit Indian, South African and Schengen Zone visas and 150 passports from 10 different countries along with a laptop and smart phones.</p>\r\n<p>The statement did not say how the gang obtained the authentic visas. And the State Department did not say how many people were believed to have illegally entered the United States and other countries using visas issued by the crime ring, which used bribery to operate unhindered.</p>\r\n<p>Visas for Western countries are in high demand in Africa and embassies say the visa market is a big target for organized crime.</p>\r\n<p>The real U.S. embassy in Ghana is a prominent and heavily fortified complex in Cantonments, one of the capital's most expensive neighborhoods. Lines of people queue outside each day for visa appointments and other consular business.</p>\r\n<p>The fake embassy was open three mornings a week and did not accept walk-in appointments. Instead, the criminals advertised on billboards in Ghana, Togo and Ivory Coast and brought clients from across West Africa to Accra where they rented them hotel rooms in nearby hotels.</p>\r\n<p>U.S. authorities conducting a broader security operation were tipped off about it and assembled a team including the Ghana Detectives Bureau and police as well as other international partners to shut down the ring.</p>\r\n<p>Source: <a href=\"http://www.reuters.com/article/us-ghana-usa-crime-idUSKBN13T0GQ\" target=\"_blank\">Reuters</a></p>",

They are all unsatisfied because they haven’t yet received the advance payment of the wage for November,\"</em> the union leader explained.</p>\r\n<p>A miners’ delegation is to meet Tuesday morning the director general of the national company for mines Aurel Anghel in the attempt to find solutions to the crisis.</p>\r\n<p>The trade union leader said he would request the intervention of the Economy Ministry in solving the protest and to set a timetable for rescheduling the payments for the supplied coal, including for the months of December 2016 and January 2017 – at least the wages could be covered, he said.</p>\r\n<p>\"The miners are discontent. There are problems coming from behind, it’s a situation hard to handle as there are also problems with the lack of equipments. We ask for guarantees that the money will be paid,\" Domokos said.</p>\r\n<p>Source: <a href=\"https://www.nineoclock.ro/hunedoara-paroseni-and-uricani-miners-protest-360-people-blocked-themselves-underground/\" target=\"_blank\">Nine o'clock</a></p>\r\n<p> </p>",

Formal resignation at 19:00. Thanks to everyone and viva l'Italia!\" (\"long live Italy!\") he tweeted. This being Italy, 19:00 (7 pm) came and went, and Renzi had still not resigned.</p>\r\n<p>- Better luck at PlayStation -</p>\r\n<p>Ironically, Renzi's rule came to an end with his government winning a vote of confidence in the Senate, the parliamentary chamber he tried to emasculate with a referendum in which he suffered a crushing defeat on Sunday.</p>",

                "Continut": "<p>Lawmakers in South Korea's National Assembly have voted to impeach President Park Geun-hye.</p>\r\n<p>Under the South Korean constitution, impeachment requires a two-thirds majority of the 300-member legislature to pass.  The vote passed by 234 votes to 56. There were six abstentions.</p>\r\n<p>The impeachment is only the country's second. In 2004, late President Roh Moo-hyun was also forced out of office for two months. The Constitutional Court later restored Roh to power, rejecting charges of abuse of power and mismanagement.</p>\r\n<p>The court's nine members need to return a two-thirds majority to impeach. In that case, a new election would be held within 60 days.</p>\r\n<p>Last month, Park said that she would allow the National Assembly to decide the duration of her remaining term in office, and will resign if that is what they decide.</p>\r\n<div class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">\"I will relegate the decision to the National Assembly, including the shortening of my presidential term and resignation,\" she said. \"If the National Assembly sets a path for the stable transition of power, I will resign from the presidency and lessen the confusion as much as possible. I hope that the nation will find stability,\" she added.</div>\r\n<p>Park has faced terrible approval ratings and massive protests since it emerged that her confidante and adviser, Choi Soon-sil, had access to confidential government documents despite holding no official government position.</p>\r\n<p>Choi is accused of using her relationship with Park to accumulate millions of dollars in donations to her foundations and has been detained after being charged with abuse of power, fraud and coercion.</p>\r\n<p>Offices have been raided, top executives hauled in for questioning and two of Park's former Presidential aides, among others, have also been indicted.</p>\r\n<p>As President, Park is currently immune from prosecution. Though her lawyers have said she is willing to cooperate with the investigation, last month she claimed to be too busy to meet with prosecutors.</p>\r\n<div class=\"zn-body__paragraph\">In a recent poll by Gallup Korea, Park's approval rating was at 5% - up a point from her dismal previous showing of 4%. It also indicated showed that 81% of those polled supported her impeachment, <a href=\"http://edition.cnn.com/2016/12/09/asia/south-korea-park-geun-hye-impeachment-vote/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">CNN</a> reports.</div>",

Schmitt-Matzen said the boy asked him how he would know 'where I get to where I'm going?' knowing he was dying. Santa told him to tell them 'You're my Number One elf' so they'd take care of him.</p>\r\n<p>The child then asked if Santa could help save him, but before he could answer, the boy died in his arms...</p>\r\n<p><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/b8rAy6wjR6E\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></p>",

Ben Hodges, in Zagan, western Poland. An Armored Brigade Combat Team from Fort Carson, Colorado will be deployed there early next month, while another U.S. force, a battalion, will be deployed April 1 to Orzysz, in the northeast.</p>\r\n<p>Macierewicz said he was \"very happy that a decision has been taken by the U.S. side for an earlier deployment.\" <a class=\"smallbox\" href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/dec/14/us-deployment-poland-romania-baltic\" target=\"_blank\">bla</a></p>\r\n<p>He did not say if the accelerated timetable was due to the 20 January inauguration of Donald Trump as US president. Trump has suggested he would like Europe to rely less on the US for its defense, according to <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/dec/14/us-deployment-poland-romania-baltic\" target=\"_blank\">The Guardian</a>. </p>\r\n<p>But the U.S. Army told <a href=\"http://bigstory.ap.org/article/poland-us-accelerate-troop-deployment-baltics\" target=\"_blank\">The Associated Press</a> that the deployment was not accelerated and is taking place as had always been scheduled. </p>\r\n<p>Hodges said the troops will arrive in the German port of Bremerhaven on January 6, 2017 and will be immediately deployed to Poland, the Baltic states and Romania. Their transfer will be timed and treated as a test of \"how fast the force can move from port to field,\" he added.</p>\r\n<p>\"I'm confident in the very powerful signal, the message it will send (that) the United States, along with the rest of NATO, is committed to deterrence,\" pointed out Ben Hodges.</p>",

                "Continut": "<p>The parliament approved a mechanism that would allow for the suspension of visa-free regimes with Ukraine and Georgia under certain circumstances once they are in place. The vote was 485 to 132, with 21 abstentions. The EU lawmakers are now set to vote on the visa liberalization itself for Georgia in January, and it is possible that they will vote on Ukraine in February.<br /><br />The actual visa-free regimes for both countries will kick in when the suspension mechanism is legally adopted and published in the EU’s official journal, which requires translation and other work that is expected to take up to eight weeks.<br /><br />Both the EU member states and the European Parliament gave the green light for free movement for Ukrainian and Georgian citizens earlier this autumn, but struggled to agree on the suspension-mechanism text that had to be in place before granting visa liberalization. A compromise was struck last week that will give both individual EU member states and the European Parliament a say in suspending the visa-free regime if the rules are violated.</p>\r\n<p>Visa requirements can be reintroduced temporarily if there is a surge of citizens from a non-EU country like Ukraine or Georgia staying irregularly in EU territory or if nationals from that country are deemed to pose a security threat. They can also be reintroduced if there is a rise in unfounded asylum applications or a lack of cooperation on returning migrants.<br /><br />Ukraine and Georgia are seeking greater integration with the West but have been frustrated with the pace of EU moves to bring them closer. Both former Soviet republics have faced military aggression from Russia in recent years, as well as other efforts by Moscow to increase its influence.<br /><br />The EU Schengen Area countries are Austria, Belgium, the Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Italy, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, and Sweden.</p>\r\n<p>Source: <a href=\"http://www.rferl.org/a/european-parliament-visa-free-travel-georgia-ukraine-travel/28178124.html\" target=\"_blank\">rferl.org</a></p>",

                "Continut": "<p>The European Union decided Thursday to extend its sanctions against Russia due to Moscow's annexation of the Ukrainian peninsula of Crimea.</p>\r\n<p>Ahead of the EU leaders summit, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Francois Hollande called on their 26 EU counterparts to retain the ongoing sanctions should Russia fail to implement the Minsk accord for peace in the region. </p>\r\n<p>The sanctions will now continue until July 2017 and affect Russia's defense, energy and financial sectors. The formal process to extend the sanctions will take place early next week, said European Union diplomats. The EU has not sanctioned Russia over its involvement in the Syrian war.</p>\r\n<p>The sanctions have been in place since 2014 following the Crimea annexation and the downing of Malaysian Airlines flight MH17 in eastern Ukraine. Western countries and Ukraine accused pro-Russian separatists of bringing down the airliner that had 298 people on board. Russia has denied the accusation.</p>\r\n<p>Source: <a href=\"http://www.dw.com/en/eu-leaders-agree-to-extend-russia-sanctions-until-mid-2017/a-36785835\">Deutsche Welle</a></p>",

                "Continut": "<p>A total of 54 people have been hospitalized, with some in a coma.</p>\r\n<p>The injured and dead appear to be residents of the same area in Irkutsk and, according to officials, they were not drinking alcohol together, and are socially disadvantaged people aged 35 to 50. The Investigative Committee said that this bath lotion was available at about 100 outlets in Irkutsk.</p>\r\n<p>Methanol (also known as methyl alcohol), a light, colorless, flammable liquid, has been detected in the composition of Boyaryshnik (Hawthorn) bath lotion. The lotion bottles were marked with warnings that they are not for internal use.</p>\r\n<p>Two suspects believed to be directly involved in the distribution of the surrogate alcohol have been detained.</p>\r\n<p>The Prime Minister of Russia Dmitry Medvedev called the problem with the turnover of alcohol-containing substances in Russia heavy. The Prime Minister instructed the government to deal with trafficking liquids that contain alcohol in Russia, saying that it has turned into a business. He also drew attention that such liquids are sold just in the room, and called it a \"mess\" by giving the order to prohibit such sales.</p>\r\n<p>Although poisonings with surrogate alcohol are not uncommon in Russia, the Irkutsk incident appears to be one of the most fatal in years.</p>",

The Ukrainian side of the Joint Center for Control and Coordination (JCCC) immediately made a request for the introduction of the ceasefire. But the enemy attempted to make a significant turning movement of the Ukrainian fortified positions near the village of Luhanske in order to oust the advanced units of the ATO forces from their positions and change the contact line. <a class=\"smallbox\" href=\"http://www.unian.info/war/1685481-militant-attack-at-svitlodarsk-duha-enemy-retreat-many-dead-and-wounded.html\" target=\"_blank\">bla</a></p>\r\n<p>The adversary forces, being in significant numbers, resorted to bypassing, attempting to cut off the ATO strongpoints. <em>\"But their plans were uncovered just in time. The battle, which followed, thwarted the invaders' plans. During the two-hour battle, our troops defeated the enemy fighters,\"</em> it said. </p>\r\n<p>According to intelligence reports, enemy losses amounted to at least 25 people dead and 30 wounded.</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p><em>\"Unfortunately, we've had losses. Five soldiers were killed, six were wounded. Four of the soldiers were injured slightly and two had moderately severe injuries. All the injured have been provided with high-quality medical care,\"</em> the ATO HQ said.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>In addition, civilian infrastructure and power lines were damaged as militants have repeatedly opened fire from 122mm artillery systems and 120mm mortars on the Ukrainian positions. The town of Svitlodarsk and surrounding villages were left without electricity. Late at night, three artillery shells exploded near a school in Luhanske.</p>\r\n<p>Source: <a href=\"http://www.unian.info/war/1685481-militant-attack-at-svitlodarsk-duha-enemy-retreat-many-dead-and-wounded.html\" target=\"_blank\">UNIAN</a></p>",
