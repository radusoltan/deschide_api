Unlocking the funding from external partners will have an impact on inflation factors but will not be a significant one maintaining the trend of reaching the bottom threshold of inflation. This aid will decrease gradually but not significantly the national currency. I think that NBM will betake the easing of the monetary policy by decreasing the interest rate in the near future\",</em> considers the PhD in Economics Sveatoslav Mihalache.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>Sergiu Gaibu thinks that the macroeconomic parameters allow the decrease of the interest rate, but NBM by its decision taken yesterday reinsures itself.</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p><em>\"I think it is a decision with enhanced wariness because the macroeconomic parameters allow a decrease in the interest rate. But this decision taken by NBM comes before the fall and winter seasons and is prepared for money needs' growth. NBM probably intends to supplement currency reserves\".</em></p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>Roman Chirca considers that NBM does not feel the right conjuncture to decrease this rate in order to avoid a liquidity surplus.</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p><em>\"The NBM probably does not feel right conjuncture to decrease this rate in order to avoid a liquidity surplus. Yesterday's decision was taken not to spur inflation and to put pressure on the national currency. If macroeconomic parameters will continue at the same pace then the decrease of the interest rate is obvious\"</em>, mentioned Roman Chirca.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>We are reminding that yesterday the Executive Board of the National Bank of Moldova, decided to mantain the interest rate applied to the main monetary policy operations in the short term at the current 10.0 percent annually.</p>",

Instead, the <strong>audit highlights the quality of the projects, quality of the established goals in these projects. Thus, the period of preparing the projects will be given a more thorough attention and will be done a more qualitative work for implementing these projects. </strong>The lack of cooperation from the Republic of Moldova is recognized as an obstacle, and this may be explained by frequent change of governments. Fundamental changes have occurred in the creation of coalitions. The report is referring to the period of 2007, when the Communists were governing, until 2015, when happened many political crises, which somehow explains, but does not justify the the lack of cooperation from the Moldovan side\", </em>added Chirca.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>In conclusion, Chirca mentioned that the audit is a successful one and suggests that European technical assistance could be managed more efficiently: \"<em>This is a feature of the performance audit. Based on a methodology, this type of audit is more subjective than the compliance audit, in which we can see how the allocated project funds are spend</em>\". </p>\r\n<p>On the other hand, the expert Sergiu Gaibu considers that, upon submission of this report,<strong> the European Commission will be more rezerved to allocate new funds in a short period of time. However, a positive aspect on long-term is that more efficient mechanisms will be implemented to manage these funds.  </strong></p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p><em>\"It is a good thing that the money that will come, will be managed by better mechanisms. The most part of this money will contribute at Moldova's development. When the trust will be regained, then the money will go to citizens <em>benefit</em>\", added Gaibu.</em></p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>We remind that the <a href=\"/en/news/political/340/DOC--The-report-from-the-European-Court-of-Auditors-The-financing-of-Moldova-%E2%82%AC782-million-disappeared-forever.htm\" target=\"_blank\">report of European Court of Auditors</a> regarding the audit on the financing of Republic of Moldova during 2007-2015 was published yesterday. In this report is mentioned that Republic of Moldova received - since 2007 - financial aid amounting to €782 million which represents nearly €37 per inhabitant. This is <em>\"the highest amount among the EU’s eastern neighbours\". </em> </p>\r\n<p>The authors of the document also say that the EU faces significant challenges in implementing assistance for Moldova and that they found only limited evidence showing the EU aid had contributed effectively to the progress of Republic of Moldova.</p>\r\n<p>It should be noted that the President of Parliament, Andrian Candu, stated that <a href=\"/en/news/political/364/Candu-We-will-discuss-the-European-Court-of-Auditors'-report-Three-institutions-are-responsible!.htm\" target=\"_blank\">the competent institutions will prepare a report about the European audit</a> on the matter of the funds granted to the Republic of Moldova.

During these two years, exports to the EU grew by over 13%, while to other markets declined by more than 25%.<br /><br />The data were presented in a summing up conference entitled “DCFTA: Two Years of Implementation. “The EU market is a solution for saving Moldova’s exports and the economy in general,” stated the minister of economy.<br /><br />Speaking about other accomplishments, the official said changes were made to the legislation and the list of authorizing documents was shortened by over 25%. A moratorium was instituted on state inspections, while the inspections at small and medium-sized companies were made consultative in character for a three-year-period.<br /><br />Net investments in the first quarter of this year came to over US$35 million, a 1.1 time increase compared with the fourth quarter of 2015. The joint companies and companies with foreign capital accounted for about 23% of the total investments made in the country.<br /><br />Speaking about the anticipated long-term benefits of the DCFTA, specialists of the Ministry of Economy said an additional growth of 5.4% in the GDP is expected. Also, Moldova’s balance-of-trade is projected to improve based on a 16% rise in exports to the EU and an 8% increase in imports from the EU.<br /><br />Attending the event, Head of the EU Delegation to Moldova Pirkka Tapiola said the implementation of the DCFTA will really contribute to strengthening and developing Moldova’s trade, to creating new jobs and attracting investments and to implementing a broader set of reforms in the economy.<br /><br />By signing the DCFTA, which is a component part of the Moldova - EU Association Agreement, the country pledged to do reforms in the energy and commercial policy sectors with a view to harmonizing the national legislation with the Community acquis.</p>\r\n<p>Source: IPN</p>",

                "lead": "The Government of the Republic of Moldova assumes responsibility for more laws referring to the transparency of the financial-banking system, but also the conversion of emergency loans offered by the Executive to those three banks that were liquidated, for the state debt. All these are conditions of the International Monetary Fund in order to sign a new agreement with Moldova.",
                "Continut": "<p>It is about 7 laws regarding the supplement and modification of the state budget, completion of the law referring to the social insurance, completion of the law about medical insurance and, also, the conversion of emergency loans offered to those three banks that were liquidated for the state debt. In addition, there are laws that refer to the transparency of the financial-banking sector inclusively of the bank's shareholders, all of these are required by the IMF to sign an agreement with Moldova.</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p><em>„On the line of willingness to continue the economic development, for these laws the Government should assume responsibility, they are laws that have been consulted with IMF. These laws should enforce as quickly as possible, and we know that now occurs the election campaign. We may be criticized for these laws, but I said that we here, in the Government, do not deal with the election campaign. They are laws that are based on securing the financial and banking system and to prevent robbing, also on the amendments to the state budget. These laws were coordinated with the IMF and with the parliamentary majority,” </em>declared Pavel Filip.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>We remind you that after the last visit of the IMF representatives in Moldova, the Prime Minister Pavel Filip stated repeatedly that he is convinced about the fact that in October Moldova will have an agreement with the Fund.</p>\r\n<p>It should be noted that the experts of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the authorities of the Republic of Moldova have reached an agreement in July at staff level regarding the program of economic reforms supported by a 3 year funding arrangement through the Extended Fund Facility (EFF) and Extended credit Facility (ECF). The access to financing is proposed to be established at a level of 75% of Moldova's quota at IMF (129 million SDR, or about 179 million US dollars). This agreement at staff level will have to be approved by IMF management an the Executive Board. </p>\r\n<p>About the conversion in state debt of the emergency loans, in July the Parliamentary Committee for economy, budget and finance rejected the law project referring to the state debt amounting 13,5 billions lei, granted by the National Bank to those three robbed banks - Banca de Economii, Banca Sociala and Unibank.  </p>\r\n<p>Earlier in March the National Bank signed a Memorandum with the Ministry of Finance for the issue of bonds to repay the emergency loans of 13.5 billion lei granted to Banca de Economii, Unibank and Banca Sociala. If this emission would be treated as a classic credit, from the state budget should be paid nearly one billion lei for 25 years.</p>\r\n<p><strong><br /></strong></p>\r\n<p><strong><br /></strong></p>",

These funds have been dissipated to numerous overseas jurisdictions, and Kroll’s findings demonstrate that the range of beneficiaries of the fraud extends beyond companies and individuals connected to the Shor Group.",

Kroll’s investigation has uncovered a complex and coordinated money laundering structure, involving hundreds of companies and bank accounts across multiple jurisdictions.</p>\r\n<p>In total, more than USD 3 billion in new loans was paid out by the Three Moldovan Banks in the period 2012 to 2014. These funds were largely channeled through a coordinated international money laundering structure, with a significant proportion of the new loan funds being returned to Moldova to pay down prior loans.</p>\r\n<p>Kroll and Steptoe and Johnson continue to work with regulators and other relevant stakeholders in multiple jurisdictions, including Latvia and Estonia, to obtain further disclosure to identify the ultimate beneficiaries so that action can be taken to recover the stolen funds.</p>\r\n<p>Kroll is keeping the NBM regularly appraised of its progress, in what is an extremely complex investigation involving thousands of transactions, created to deliberately disguise the ultimate destination and beneficiaries of the fraud. Significant progress has been made, the details of which must remain confidential to maximize the chance of recoveries.</p>\r\n<p>The fraud resulted in the collapse in late 2014 of Banca Economii SA (\"BEM\"), Banca Sociala SA (\"BS\"), and Unibank SA (\"UB\"), (together, the \"Three Moldovan Banks\"), and the disappearance of up to USD 1 billion.</p>\r\n<p>Kroll’s investigation is part of an ongoing investigation into transactions of the Three Moldovan Banks during the period 2012 to 2014, with the ultimate goal of recovering funds worldwide from the wrongdoers, as well as the identification of all parties who knowingly participated in and benefited from the fraud, including parties and financial institutions outside Moldova.</p>\r\n<p>The first phase of investigation uncovered clear evidence of the central involvement of Mr. Ilan Shor and companies and individuals connected to him (together “The Shor Group”) in the fraud. This commenced a fund flow analysis with the aim of tracing funds fraudulently obtained during 2014, to their end destination.</p>",

Statements to this effect were made at a today’s news conference held at the Chisinau-based World Bank Office</strong><strong>, informs <a href=\"http://www.moldpres.md/en/news/2016/10/05/16007909\" target=\"_blank\">MOLDPRES.</a></strong></p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p><em>\"We anticipate a revival of the economy in 2016, as a result of better outcomes in the agriculture. We expect the signing of an agreement with IMF in October, which will unlock the foreign financing, including that from the World Bank, which has comprised 45 million dollars for Moldova in its budget,\"</em> a WB expert, Ruslan Piontkivsky, said.   </p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>According to Piontkivsky, the inflation rate will stay within the five percent target, set by the World Bank. The current account deficit will be about six percent and will maintain at the level of 2015. Against a background of high interest rates and political risks related to the presidential elections, the investments level will be low. At the same time, Moldova no longer has a low level of debt, but got closer to the countries with higher debt risk. <em>\"Also, a slight decrease in poverty, an enhancement in consumers’ trust will be recorded. The public money will be consolidated and the state budget deficit will drop under three percent, at it is at present,\"</em> the expert noted.      </p>\r\n<p>Despite the austere situation, <em>\"the value, in real terms, of the transfers to households will be maintained.\"</em></p>\r\n<p>The Ministry of Economy in last August revised upwards the figures of the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) for 2016 to two per cent, against one per cent, as the ministry forecast in the beginning of this year. GDP is estimated at 132.7 billion lei for 2016.   </p>\r\n<p>The economic activity was sped up in Moldova in the second quarter, backed by a dynamic consumption of households and growth in some sectors. The Gross Domestic Product increased, in real terms, by 1.8 percent in April-June, following an advance of 0.8 percent in the first three months of 2016, according to data by the National Statistics Bureau.    </p>",

The banking sector in Moldova is the element that made it possible to transform the country into a regional money laundering centre, since 2005. Conclusions are available in a digest published by Transparency International - Moldova, with the support of experts in the field .",
                "Continut": "<p>In the digest is mentioned that this sector was used for obtaining financial resources from the currency reserves of the National Bank of Moldova in 2014 through the \"billions theft\", with a further conversion of the debts and gaps in state debt. All these have created major risks for the state security, financial system, and also for citizens partially. These risks are generated by the transit and extracting financial resources of Moldovan, of citizens who work inclusively abroad, and placing them in offshore zones, in risky second hand commercial banks, under the jurisdiction of international sanctions effect, reports <a href=\"http://ipn.md/en/economie-business/79647\" target=\"_blank\">IPN</a>. </p>\r\n<p>Recent developments in the local banking sector highlight two distinct phases of erosion of this sector's security, which at one time intercalated. The authors mention the period 2005-2014 characterized by money laundering from the region through the banking system with the help of judicial system and under the protection and guidance from those governing.</p>\r\n<p>As well, it is about 2014-2016 - the stage related to the billions theft from the banking system, including NBM, with the conversion of created gaps into state debt, put on the shoulders of ordinary citizens. The theft was conceived and accomplished by interest groups with representatives among political elites, in the conditions of state institutions captivity and their leaders, who are vulnerable and easy to blackmail.</p>\r\n<p>According to experts, in the case of BEM, the bank owned in majority by the state, is a clear example of raider, robbing and decapitalizing applied by some interest groups. The things were amplified from 2011 with a raider attack on a portion of shares to become a shareholder of BEM. Banca de Economii has been regularly inspected by the state, and at certain times - by interest groups who became nontransparently shareholders of BEM due to inaction and tacit approvals from state institutions, including NBM. BEM was attacked with the aim to deprive the state of majority package in two phases staged differently.</p>\r\n<p>The experts consider the banking sector is controlled by several groups of interests, which generate additional risks. The lack of transparency as regards final beneficiaries, presence of affiliated persons in the bank’s portfolios and bad loans as a result are evident. It is not only about the banks that are being liquidated. Such conclusions also derive from the events of 2014, when three banks reached a \"deplorable\" state as a result of similar scenarios planned in a coordinated way.</p>\r\n<p>According to the experts, the risk of contamination of the financial system persists. Several other financial institutions, including from the insurance and leasing sectors and savings and loan associations, can form part of the same scenario in the future. The money entrusted by the people to these entities is in danger mainly owing to the complicity between the state authorities and different groups of interests that manage the financial flows in the Republic of Moldova.</p>",

The Association’s members support the new amendments to the Law on the Entrepreneur’s Patent, which provide for the annulment of the patent for trading activities and for the introduction of a new conception in the Tax Code of the Republic of Moldova, of ‘independent activity’, IPN reports.",
                "Continut": "<p>The notion of ‘independent activity’ envisions a simplified taxation and trading regime for private individuals who obtain revenues from independent commercial activity. The independent commercial activity will be registered by submitting an application to the local body of the State Tax Service. The ceiling on sales revenues will be raised two times, while the tax will represent 1% of the sales revenues. The entrepreneurs will be also exempted from paying local taxes.<br /><br />The new amendments make the use of cash registers mandatory. First of all, this will enable to correctly asses the incomes obtained from independent commercial activities and, simultaneously, to protect the rights of consumers who, if necessary, will be able to call the Consumer Protection Agency. The new conception envisions greater transparency in commercial activities without increasing the fiscal burden on the entrepreneurs performing such activities.<br /><br />According to the FIA, the current system of patents, owing to the fact that the patent holders are obliged to keep financial accounts, allows avoiding paying taxes and trading illegally. This jeopardizes the country’s economic growth.<br /><br />The Foreign Investors Association is a non-profit association of Moldova founded in September 2003 by the largest foreign investors of the country with the support of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development.</p>",

The total balance of loans decreased by 16.4 percent as of the end of September compared to the same month of the previous year.  At the same time, total balances of deposits over the last twelve months grew by 3.4 percent.</p>\r\n<p>The average rate of new loans granted in national currency decreased by 0.56 percentage points, compared to June 2016, accounting for 13.59 percent. The rate on new deposits attracted in MDL decreased by 3.11 percentage points, up to the level of 7.60 percent in September 2016.</p>\r\n<p>According to a new round of forecasting, the average annual inflation rate for 2016 and 2017 is expected to record levels of 6.3 percent and 4.6 percent, respectively. Depending on the complexity of risks and uncertainties associated with the evolution of inflation in the medium term, the NBM has reshaped the annual average forecast of inflation compared to the previous forecast published in August 2016, reducing it by 0.4 percentage point for 2016, and increasing it by 0.2 percentage points for 2017.</p>\r\n<p>The monetary policy continues to be affected by the complexity of risk balance and uncertainties associated with the development of internal and external environment.

An economic activity below its potential level will cause in the long-term increased dis-inflationary pressures from aggregate demand.</p>\r\n<p>Inflation Report no.4, 2016 includes a more detailed assessment of the macroeconomic situation, inflation forecast in the medium-term and potential risks and challenges that will be faced by the monetary policy in the next period. The report will be published on 27 October 2016 as scheduled.</p>\r\n<p>NBM will continue to manage firmly the liquidity excess through sterilization operations, according to the announced schedule.</p>\r\n<p>National Bank will continue to offer banks liquidity, according to the schedule announced for 2016, through REPO operations with the term of 14 days, at a fixed rate equal to the base rate of the National Bank plus a margin of 0.25 points percentage.</p>\r\n<p>NBM will further monitor and anticipate the domestic and international economic environment developments, so that by the flexibility of operational framework specific for the inflation targeting strategy to ensure price stability in the medium term.</p>\r\n<p>The next meeting of the Executive Board of the NBM on monetary policy will take place on 24 November 2016, according to the announced schedule.</p>",

                "lead": "\"Codru\" hotel from the capital - which is known that it would belong to the First Deputy President of the Democratic Party, Vlad Plahotniuc - was bought by Moldova Agroindbank. According to a press release posted on the institution website,  \"The Bank Council has decided to relocate the headquarters of MAIB in the building where now is located the hotel complex \"Codru\".",
                "Continut": "<p>Moldova Agroindbank has reached a high level of development, investing in quality, innovation and modern infrastructure  these 25 years. In order to continue to maintain the position of the leader of the national banking system and to increase the performance, it needs a new building for Central Office, the current headquarters using its full capacity, it is mentioned in the press release.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Recently, the Bank held a public auction concerning the purchase of a building for relocation of the headquarters, with demanding to fulfill the needs and visions of a future head office of MAIB. As a result of the examination of multiple offers, at the proposal of the Management Board, the Bank Council decided in favor of the hotel complex \"Codru\", location of which corresponds the most to the technical requirements set - pathways to the main thoroughfares in the city, court and related land surface for parking, rooms for training center activities of the bank etc.</strong></p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p><em>\"The Bank is looking for several years for a new headquarters of the Central office because the current building is not spacious for the existing number of sub-units. This situation creates inconveniences, consumes more resources, time and decreases the effectiveness of collaboration between Central Bank departments, which is 60% of the staff, who is now located in several locations in different sectors of the city, increasing the efforts and the expenses of related logistics. At the same time, currently, MAIB is implementing a large project transformation of the bank, which means the reorganization of the business model by focusing staff on the branch network and agencies staff on the quality and timeliness of customer service, proactive sales. It involves the centralization of the operational control and technical processing of operations and transactions of subsidiaries office in a modern Back Office. Of course this project also means a shift in the number of staff in the Central Office, the expansion of departments and creation of new ones. Thus, a new building will ensure the highest present and future needs of our industry.\",</em> commented the decision the MAIB Board Chairman, Serghei Cebotari.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>The Bank initiated the development of the specifications for the reconstruction project of the building complex based on the latest design trends and technologies in the field, so the future headquarters of MAIB to become a building of reference in the capital architectural terms. Until the start of reconstruction work in the next 3-5 months maximum, the hotel complex \"Codru\" will continue to operate under the current type of activity.</p>\r\n<p>The Codru hotel, with a total area of 12,600 square meters, was state property until December 2008 when the company was privatized by the Daranian Holdings Limited from Cyprus, which paid 50.3 million lei, a price considered as a derisory one. A report by the Court of Accounts determined that from this transaction, the state was to collect at least 212 million lei, i.e. four times more. The press wrote that behind the transaction would sit the former first deputy PD, Vlad Plahotniuc. Shortly after the privatization of real estate, the Daranian Holding transferred the hotel to another offshore - the Investment Development Group.</p>\r\n<p>In September 2010, the Investment Development Group was selling that shareholding, so the Codru hotel becomes the property of Finpar Victoria Limited, one of two associates of Finpar Invest SRL.</p>\r\n<p>Already in May 2012, according to a statement from the State Register of the Legal Persons, the only member of Finpar Invest SRL was OTIV Prime Real Estate B.V. from Netherlands. Also, on several occasions,  in media appeared the information that OTIV Holding belongs to Vlad Plahotniuc, and the name comes from the initials of the names of his family members: Oxana, Timofei, Inochentie and Vladimir.</p>",

As of August 2016, the three largest banks in Moldova remained under the control of a special National Bank due to the concerns about the lack of transparency of their respective owners, connected lending, weak corporate governance and poor quality of the portfolios.</p>\r\n<p>It is noted that a preliminary agreement of the Government of Moldova on a new program with the IMF (about $ 180 million, which is equivalent to 3% of GDP) was achieved in July 2016, the approval of which depends on the execution by the authorities of the Moldovan Republic of the provisional measures. This event helped to unlock the first tranche of budget support from Romania in the amount of 60 million Euros, provided in August 2016.</p>\r\n<p>It is expected that the approval and the implementation of the IMF program will unlock a new international budgetary support provided to Moldova by other donors.</p>\r\n<p>According to EBRD forecasts, the economic growth in Moldova in 2016 will reach 1.5%, in 2017 - 2.5%. Let us remind that the Ministry of Economy of Moldova has improved the forecast for GDP growth in Moldova in 2016 from 1% to 2%, and for 2017 – from 2.5% to 3%. In October, the IMF has improved its forecast for the economic growth in Moldova for this year and the next year, raising the country's GDP growth forecast in 2016 from 0.5% to 2%, and for 2017 - from 2.5% to 3%. According to World Bank actualized forecasts, Moldova's GDP will grow by 2.2% in 2016, and in 2017-2018 the increase will be of 2.8-3.3%. The Independent Analytical Center Expert-Grup predicts an average GDP growth in the range of 1-3% in the coming years. The National Institute of Economic Research (INCE) expects that GDP growth in Moldova in 2016 will be of 2.5%.</p>",

                "Continut": "<p>According to the website of the Ministry of Finance, \"Banca de Economii\" has returned from the emergency credit - 9.17 million lei, the Social Bank - 16 million and Unibank - 1 million. So far, there were recovered around 811.14 million lei of these loans, i.e. in October were returned 26.41 million MDL.</p>\r\n<p>\n\t\t\t<div class=\"cs_img \"  style=\"width:772px;\">\n\t\t\t <p><a href=\"/images/cms-image-000004216.jpg\" class=\"photoViewer\" title=\"\"> \t\t\t\t<img src=\"/get_img?ImageWidth=772&amp;ImageHeight=479&amp;ImageId=4216\"   border=\"0\"/>\n\t\t\t </a></p> \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\n</p>\r\n<p>For four months since this meter was published online, were returned about 139 million lei, at first being displayed the total amount of 672 million, and so far it has been repaid 811.14 million MDL from the emergency loan.</p>\r\n<p>According to the economic expert Sergiu Gaibu, these recovered money from the three banks will actually be used to pay the state debt interest in which have been converted the loans granted under state guarantee.</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p><em>\"I suspect that these recoveries are made from the banks' assets, from fixed means as well from the credit portfolio were recovered. The average speed of recovery shows a fairly large term of these recoveries. In this context we should not forget about the cost of state debt, namely about the interest that in it's 10th year will be 5% annually, and this interest must be paid firstly. In conclusion, from these recoveries it will be practically covered only the interest from the State guarantees from all the term of 25 years,\"</em> said Gaibu.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>We must emphasize that according to the law through which the Government assumed the responsibility, the state will return to the National Bank, during 25 years, the amount of 13.58 billion MDL. In the first 10 years, the amounts are much smaller than those that the state will have to \"pour\" into NBM accounts in the last 10 years. In the first year the state has to pay 50 million and an interest rate of 1.4%, but in the last years the rates reach the figure of 900 million and even 1.05 billion the last year. Since the 10th year of refund, along with the amounts of money, will also increase the annual nominal interest rate to 5.3%.</p>",

Those who still do not believe that, we will convince them by actions.</em></p>\r\n<p><em>After today's decision of the International Monetary Fund, our credibility towards investors and international partners will increase. The high level of transparency and independent assessment of progress in the next period, will facilitate commitments by the authorities in front of their citizens.

                "lead": "IMF Executive Board approved US$178.7 million Arrangements under the Extended Fund Facility and the Extended Credit Facility for the Republic of Moldova yesterday.",
                "Continut": "<p>In a press release from IMF is mentioned that the Fund approved three-year<strong> </strong>arrangements <strong>under the Extended Fund Facility (EFF) and the Extended Credit Facility (ECF) with the Republic of Moldova to support the country’s economic and financial reform program.</strong></p>\r\n<p>Therefore, the cumulative access under the arrangements is about US$178.7 million, or 75 percent of the Republic of Moldova’s quota in IMF.</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p><em>\"About US$35.9 million will be made available to the Moldovan authorities immediately following the approval of the arrangements. The remaining amount will be phased in over the duration of the program, subject to five semi-annual program reviews,\" </em>is pointed out in the <a href=\"http://www.imf.md/press/pressw/press-161107.html\" target=\"_blank\">IMF press release</a>.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>The key objective of the program is to tackle upfront the urgent governance and stability issues in the banking sector. <strong>The program is thus centered on a successful rehabilitation of systemically important banks and radical improvements to the regulatory, supervisory, and contingency frameworks for banks, including through a demonstrated fundamental shift in the enforcement and sanctioning regime.</strong> The financial sector has been under stress for a number of years now, and a key priority would be to bring about an exit from the crisis, so that banks can resume normal financial intermediation.</p>\r\n<p><strong>The program is also expected to catalyze significant support from external donors.</strong></p>\r\n<p>Mitsuhiro Furusawa, Deputy Managing Director and Acting Chair of the yesterday discussion, declared that <em>\"the Moldovan authorities have developed a comprehensive program—to be supported by a three-year arrangement under the Extended Fund Facility and the Extended Credit Facility—to strengthen the economy and address key vulnerabilities.\"</em></p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p><em>\"The program aims at reinforcing the recent economic stabilization and advancing a broad structural reform agenda, particularly in the financial sector. Strong commitment to sound policies and a significant improvement in economic governance will be crucial to raising long-term growth prospects,\" </em>added Mitsuhiro Furusawa.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p> </p>",

It’s worrying because we have so many elections coming up over here,\" added Butterfill.</p>\r\n<p>European companies get about 17 percent of their total revenue from North America, with those in Belgium, Ireland and Switzerland among the most exposed, Morgan Stanley estimated in May. </p>\r\n<p>Through Tuesday, the Stoxx 600 had already lost about twice as much as the S&amp;P 500 Index since a high on September 5.</p>\r\n<p>Source: <a href=\"http://www.news.ro/economic/actiunile-europene-au-deschis-in-scadere-puternica-in-urma-victoriei-lui-trump-la-presedintia-sua-1922404309002016111016044852\" target=\"_blank\">News.ro</a></p>",

                "Continut": "<p>After the IMF Executive Board had approved a programme with Moldova, providing for access to financing worth about 178.7 million dollars, the Moldovan government resumed the negotiations with the World Bank on a new agreement on financing worth 45 million dollars. The group of negotiators on behalf of the Moldovan cabinet is led by Finance Minister Octavian Armasu.    </p>\r\n<p>The sides held discussions on a draft agreement on financing between the Moldovan government and the Word Bank for the Development Policy Operations programme in the competitiveness sector (DPO-2). The operation proposed is a key component of the 2014-2017 Strategic Partnership for Moldova and represents a programme of structural reforms in the investment climate field and to improve access to investment funds. The initiation of negotiations on this budgetary support programme was possible as a result of assuming, and, consecutively, implementation of a string of reforms by Moldova’s authorities.     <br /><br />The programme supports the achievement of the goals based on three pillars: improvement of the business environment’s predictability; creating equal conditions of competition and cutting costs of compliance with the present regulations; strengthening the stability of the financial sector, promoting transparency and improving access to finances, efficiency and fairness of public investments, as well as of investment subsidies in agriculture and social assistance. <br /><br />Since Moldova’s accession to the World Bank Group in 1992, over one billion dollars has been earmarked for about 60 projects in Moldova. Presently, the World Bank’s portfolio includes ten active projects with an overall commitment of more than 350 million dollars. The support fields are the regulatory reform and developing the business environment, education, social assistance, e-governance, health care, agriculture, local roads and environment.  </p>",

This can be done on the line Isaccea-Vulcanesti, but the issue still to be resolved is between Vulcăneşti and Chisinau,\"</em> said Zachia in the framework of the National Congress of the Association of Electricity Suppliers in Romania.</p>\r\n<p>The deadline of 2018 is assumed by the two governments in the agreement signed between them, said Zachia.</p>\r\n<p><em>\"The interconnection line exists, so basically we can achieve this export right now, but it is necessary to build a line between Vulcanesti and Chisinau. Theoretically, the Moldovan partners must make a project in this regard, and we can contribute to this project, if the two governments will agree this,\"</em> added the Transelectrica, quoted by <a href=\"http://infoprut.ro/45716-transelectrica-pana-in-2018-romania-va-putea-exporta-600-de-mw-de-energie-electrica-in-rep-moldova.html\">infoprut.ro</a>. </p>\r\n<p>The \"IDIS Viitorul\" expert, Victor Parlicov, commented for Deschide.MD that the terms that the two governments proposed are very ambitious and they would positively surprised if it will be respected.</p>\r\n<p><em>\"The need for these projects are vital for the Republic of Moldova. Without a diversification of energy sources, Moldova will remain a failed state project, i.e. a state whose \"life is maintained artificially.\" It is impossible to overestimate the importance of these interconnections for the Moldovan statehood,\"</em> said Victor Parlicov.</p>\r\n<p>The expert pointed out that until recently the main \"brake\" in the development of these projects was the lack of a firm commitment to Chisinau.</p>\r\n<p><em>\"But for quite some time, apparently emerged the political will and I hope that this ambitious terms will be respected. However it would be very good for authorities to make public the roadmap with the terms and phases of this project so that everyone can monitor the progress. I for instance see no problem for this roadmap to be published,\"</em> concluded the expert.</p>\r\n<p><strong> </strong></p>",

                "lead": "Layoffs in the public sector, less money for subsidy projects and increasing tariffs - are the main stipulations of the Financing Memorandum of Moldova, approved by the Executive Board of the International Monetary Fund. This is the opinion of the expert in economics, Roman Chirca.",
                "Continut": "<p>Asked by the reporter of Deschide.MD to comment on the stipulations of the new agreement with the IMF, the expert said that the main objective which the IMF aimed was setting certain commitments that would lead to establishing a financial discipline.</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p><em>\"The budget deficit amounting 3.2% of the GDP, was capped. Also,<em> certain public expenses</em> are capped. For example, it will be reduced the number of employees in the public sector by liquidating the vacant positions and even some layoffs are not excluded that will generate savings of 200 million lei. On the other hand will be capped the subsidies in agriculture and other specific branches, other aspects relevant to services and goods that will be reduced substantially, again, many of them,\"</em> he said.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>Roman Chirca also says that by the end of this year is expected a review of the public budget.</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p><em>\"A very important moment and that will effect the living costs are the tariffs. The memorandum says expressly that the prices must be adjusted to justify the cost of producing electricity, which means that we have a revision of tariffs and an essential increase. Moreover, the Memorandum stipulates a program of relaunching the economy, many aspects of tax optimization in order to increase the revenues by 1.2% after increasing fiscal responsibility by standardizing the VAT, by eliminating the phenomena of payment under the table and many other activities that were discussed in society as well,\"</em> said the expert.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>Chirca also says that two main components of the Agreement are the responsibilities and the objectives for establishing the financial- fiscal discipline, order in the banking sector, but also the basic element which provides a whole range of activities and program elements for the economic reform, boosting the entrepreneurship.</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p><em>\"Overall, it is a program that aims to create maximum fiscal discipline. This will lead to bigger <em>fiscal </em>discipline and responsibility of economic operators and citizens. It will be difficult to implement some salary increases, pensions. This means a living standard that cannot be improved through budget support, the strict control of public spending, fighting corruption, and an entire program of economic recovery,\" he said.</em></p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>Also, for the first time, the fiscal and financial discipline have to be on the second place in the Agreement, and on the first place is the order in the banking system, inclusively by approving a package of laws.</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p><em>\"An absolutely impossible thing, unless it is approved a package of laws and the main scourge is not repelled - the corruption. This thing is proposed through the judicial reform, of the prosecuting authorities, the responsible agencies for collecting taxes. The memorandum does not stipulate the mechanism that will contain the reform, it is rather a list of generalities and principles which will be taken into account. Anyway, the Memorandum implementation progress will be reviewed by the Fund missions, where, over time, many of these commitments will be evaluated. Also,<em> multiple technical assistance programs</em> are provided that will offer some consultations, including on the fight against corruption area,\"</em> said Roman Chirca.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>The expert claims that other provisions contained in the Agreement have already been circulated at a general level. Here we refer to the banking sector as being a priority one, it also listed the key commitments that Moldova assumes through special administration of the three banks: MAIB, Moldindconbank and solving of the issue related to the Victoriabank Administrative Board, developing the legislative framework.</p>",

                "lead": "The reform of the financial - banking sector that we are witnessing lately is one of the most discussed topics by Western partners who give money to Moldova. We tried to detail the subject in an interview that was given exclusively for Deschide.MD, by the Governor of the National Bank, Sergiu Cioclea. I didn't miss the chance to ask questions, which concern the citizens now: what will we see in the next period on the boards of the currency exchanges, how legal has been the sale of the hotel \"Codru\" will the Kroll-2 report be or not declassified, are money still being stolen from the Moldovan banks?",
                "Continut": "<p><strong>— Signing the agreement with the IMF which was held recently, is a success of the authorities and the institution you lead. We know it is not easy to sign an agreement with the IMF that comes with certain conditions, rigors or requirements imposed to the authorities to start the financing program. What will be the priority destination of the first tranche that already reached the NBM account?</strong></p>\r\n<p>\n\t <div align=\"center\"> \t\t<div class=\"cs_img cs_fl_left\"  style=\"width:220.8px;\">\n\t\t\t <p><a href=\"/images/cms-image-000005030.jpg\" class=\"photoViewer\" title=\"\"> \t\t\t\t<img src=\"/get_img?ImageRatio=20&amp;ImageWidth=220&amp;ImageHeight=332&amp;ImageId=5030\"   border=\"0\"/>\n\t\t\t </a></p> \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</p>\r\n<p>— The IMF agreement was approved by the Fund's Executive Board on November 7. The first tranche - 35 million US dollars - has already been transferred to the account of the National Bank. Five more will follow that by March 2019 for a program total of 180 million US dollars. From the first installment, about two thirds are for the Ministry of Finance, for budgetary support. More important it is that the IMF agreement allows us to unlock also World Bank programs: negotiations in this regard were resumed, as well as funding from the European Union. This money is important for budget financing, but also for revival of investment in our country. Much of the measures program agreed with the IMF is dedicated to promoting banking reforms, which needs to be revived urgently.</p>\r\n<p><strong>— One of the Fund's preconditions was related to the ownership transparency in the finance-banking sector. NBM has blocked a group of shareholders of the two banks. What is the fate of shares package under the administration of NBM from Moldova Agroindbank and Moldinconbank?</strong></p>\r\n<p>— One of the biggest problems in the banking sector is exactly the quality of ownership. The transparency of ownership and improvement of corporate governance are the main goals of the program agreed with the IMF and in fact, the reforms promoted by NBM. At MAIB, even my predecessor Dorin Dragutanu decided to block about 42% of the shares acquired and held by shareholders without the permission of the NBM. I think we're at the last stage of marketing these actions. They were first proposed for sale by the shareholders whose rights have been blocked. Then, after they failed to sell them, the shares have been canceled; new ones were issued in the same number, and put on sale in September. Currently we have institutional investors, who are exploring the possibility of purchasing those shares. Regarding Moldindconbank, we are at the beginning. Blocked shareholders were made aware of the obligation to sell those shares. We hope that this bank will attract a strategic investor because a majority stake will be exposed for sale. Our aim is that these measures allow a quality investor in the system and this program with the IMF is quite welcome, because it is a signal to those who would like to buy the shares in question: the signal that they can invest in Moldova.</p>\r\n<p><strong>— What are the chances for a new issue of shares and cancellation of the current package from Moldinconbank?</strong></p>\r\n<p>— At this stage we should give a chance to the current shareholders to sell their shares. It is premature to guess what will be the fate of these shares: whether they will be sold or not. The fact is that we have a procedure for the sale of MAIB shares and we hope that it constitutes a success precedent. However, we are talking of a majority interest and must be seen in case of failure, if there are other solutions of commercialization.</p>\r\n<p><strong>—</strong><strong> To what extent the acquisition of the hotel complex \"Codru\" by MAIB was coordinated with the BNM (taking into account, of course, that MAIB is under the administration of NBM) and which was the purchase price?</strong></p>\r\n<p>\n\t <div align=\"center\"> \t\t<div class=\"cs_img cs_fl_right\"  style=\"width:153px;\">\n\t\t\t <p><a href=\"/images/cms-image-000005035.jpg\" class=\"photoViewer\" title=\"\"> \t\t\t\t<img src=\"/get_img?ImageRatio=15&amp;ImageWidth=153&amp;ImageHeight=229&amp;ImageId=5035\"   border=\"0\"/>\n\t\t\t </a></p> \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</p>\r\n<p>— We cannot tell you the purchase price: it is confidential. However we, of course, put this question to the MAIB management. It was important to understand if the transaction falls or not under market prices. We had other questions, too. For example, we requested to justify the need for this procurement. The bank came up with several explanations, including technical justification that for a longer time was decided to find a new headquarters. Another question was whether competitive procedures were respected: a transparent competition, overseen by the governing bodies. However, in the end, the key question for us was whether the transaction will allow the bank to comply with prudential coefficients; the answer to this question was satisfactory. Finally, after several discussions with MAIB management and taking into account the answers that we received, we decided not to block this transaction. I recognize that it seems surprising for the public that a bank buys a hotel, but there were such precedents: Mobiasbanca, for example, bought the former hotel \"Moldova\" building, turning it into its headquarters.</p>\r\n<p><strong>— We know that for half a year, NBM lowered the base rate of the monetary policy by about 10 percentage points. Is National Bank intending to reduce further the base rate in order to cheaper loans? Why lowering the past rate has led to a slight decrease of credit interest, nor to a substantial cheapening of them?</strong></p>\r\n<p>— It is true that in half a year, we lowered the rate from 19.5 percent by year to 9 percent, more than 10 percentage points. Meanwhile, new loans granted to traders, were cheaper on average from 15% to 13%, with only 2 percentage points. We realize that not only the base rate that commercial catalyst for cheaper loans. In parallel, the commercial banks must be able to estimate the economical risk at a lower level. The interest rate reflects the economic risk. Unfortunately, we are in a phase of weak growth and some enterprises have difficulties in the repayment of loans or contracting new loans. We find that from the stock of bad loans that grows. In these circumstances, it is unlikely to see a sharp decline in credit market conditions. However we hope that the situation will improve.</p>\r\n<p><strong>— In the context of reducing the volume of remittances from the Russian Federation and exerting of pressure on the Moldovan MDL which you think that will be the foreign exchange market developments in the medium term and what factors may contribute to the stability of the currency parity?</strong></p>\r\n<p>— The MDL has suffered a significant depreciation in 2015, but it has been compensated a specific loss of competitiveness due to the devaluation of the Russian ruble and the Ukrainian hryvnia in the past. Today we do not identify significant pressures on the balance of payments that would justify a concern of depreciation of the MDL. We believe that we are in a phase of stabilization, confirmed by the evolution of exchange in 2016. We can follow, however, seasonal cycles, during the summer; we have a stronger MDL, because we have an influx of foreign exchange from export of agricultural produce and more remittances, and in winter - a slight depreciation, considering the need to use the currency to buy oil, coal and other fuels for heating etc. I remind you that the purpose of monetary policy is the price stability, namely inflation targeting not the exchange rate, which does not mean we do not care or the MDL - our interventions aim to eliminate the volatility in the Forex market but we have a flexible replacement policy.</p>\r\n<p><strong>— The second Kroll report will be made public or, as in the first report, there is a confidentiality clause?</strong></p>\r\n<p>— We are, indeed, in the second phase of the investigation that aims to detect and return the stolen money. This goal requires confidentiality as a protective measure. If the Kroll publish the names of the beneficiaries and ways through which the money will be recovered, we offer them on the tray, all the sensitive information. The confidentiality at this stage is for the good of the mission to detect and to recover the money. We do not exclude, however, that after the recovery phase, we will ask the Kroll Company to lift the confidentiality clause, so that we can publish the report.</p>\r\n<p>\n\t <div align=\"center\"> \t\t<div class=\"cs_img cs_fl_left\"  style=\"width:255.4px;\">\n\t\t\t <p><a href=\"/images/cms-image-000005031.jpg\" class=\"photoViewer\" title=\"\"> \t\t\t\t<img src=\"/get_img?ImageRatio=20&amp;ImageWidth=255&amp;ImageHeight=170&amp;ImageId=5031\"   border=\"0\"/>\n\t\t\t </a></p> \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</p>\r\n<p><strong>— Recently, from a branch of FinComBank were emptied several private safes. Earlier, the National Bank has informed us that it knows about the case. What is the total damage and what BNM has undertaken to ensure that such situations are not repeated?</strong></p>\r\n<p>— The value of goods stolen from safes have not been communicated to us: the case is investigated by the resort institutions. Let us not forget that some people who deposit goods in safes do not declare them immediately to the police. We have warned and the FinComBank and other banks on these risks and we asked for protection of audit procedures.</p>\r\n<p><strong>— In the parliament was submitted a project that plans to increase the salaries of NBM employees. Do you think that's good in the context of budget cuts in other areas, but also of the condition of the IMF not to raise salaries during this period to anyone?</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong></strong>— The IMF has not imposed a ban on individual wage increase in the budgetary sphere. The IMF condition is to decrease the growth rate of overall costs. As for the National Bank, the IMF recognizes the need to adjust the wages in order to be competing with the commercial sector. </p>\r\n<p>\n\t <div align=\"center\"> \t\t<div class=\"cs_img cs_fl_right\"  style=\"width:246.8px;\">\n\t\t\t <p><a href=\"/images/cms-image-000005034.jpg\" class=\"photoViewer\" title=\"\"> \t\t\t\t<img src=\"/get_img?ImageRatio=20&amp;ImageWidth=246&amp;ImageHeight=164&amp;ImageId=5034\"   border=\"0\"/>\n\t\t\t </a></p> \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\nThe program with the IMF and our commitments require us to increase the number of employees in certain areas (such as banking supervision) and to keep the powerful specialists, for example the lawyers and the specialists in IT who can find work in the private sector. The statistics of National Bank of Moldova confirms that we're not well in the matter of maintaining the employees in the service of National Bank, because we are in competition with the banking domain that we need to watch it. To give an example: in 2015 we employed 49 people, but resigned 54. In 2016 we hired 54 but resigned 47. It is all more regrettable, since it's about young potential. It is difficult for us to fulfill the supervisory function, and to keep the specialists without correcting the salary system at the NBM. We have now all the solutions, but we do a market study, to see more clearly the reasons why we are losing employees and where they go, to be able to come up with further proposals on wage policy adjustment at the NBM.</p>\r\n<p><strong>— Have you ever regretted during this period, that you have accepted the position of Governor of National Bank of Moldova? ...</strong></p>\r\n<p>— I do not live with regrets. If I am faced with a problem, I try to solve it. However, I admit that I went through difficult moments as well. But each time, I found a solution and I came out of these situations more wisely.</p>\r\n<p><strong>— You have started several changes, both at the National Bank of Moldova as well in the banking sector: the transparency of the shareholder, the improval of the legal framework etc. How do you appreciate them, and what is their purpose? How do you see the National Bank of Moldova in the future?</strong></p>\r\n<p>— Most importantly, these changes should be irreversible and sustainable. I think that the measure taken in the last 6-7 months marks a shift in the right direction. There are other challenges as well, many risks, I will not now pass them in the review, I would just mention that I remain optimistic and I think we will be able to cope.</p>\r\n<p>\n\t <div align=\"center\"> \t\t<div class=\"cs_img cs_fl_middle\"  style=\"width:1277px;\">\n\t\t\t <p><a href=\"/images/cms-image-000005032.jpg\" class=\"photoViewer\" title=\"\"> \t\t\t\t<img src=\"/get_img?ImageWidth=1277&amp;ImageHeight=524&amp;ImageId=5032\"   border=\"0\"/>\n\t\t\t </a></p> \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</p>",

                "lead": "The National Bank of Moldova (“NBM”) has recently received its third formal progress briefing from Kroll on its continuing investigation of a large scale fraud in the Moldovan banking sector. The fraud resulted in the collapse in late 2014 of Banca de Economii SA (“BEM”), Banca Sociala SA (“BS”), and Unibank SA (“UB”), (together, the “Three Moldovan Banks”). The investigation has identified the misappropriation of approximately USD 600 million. Tracing of the end destination of this amount is ongoing.",
                "Continut": "<p>Kroll’s investigation is part of an ongoing investigation into transactions of the Three Moldovan Banks during the period 2012 to 2014, with the ultimate goal of recovering funds worldwide from the wrongdoers, as well as the identification of all parties who knowingly participated in and benefitted from the fraud, including individuals, companies and financial institutions.</p>\r\n<p>Kroll has continued to trace the proceeds of fraudulent loans granted to Shor Group companies acting in concert between January 2012 and November 2014, prior to the collapse of the Three Moldovan Banks. The tracing exercise has revealed additional layers of complexity in the structure used to launder the proceeds of the fraud, which involves hundreds of company bank accounts in multiple jurisdictions (including Latvia and Estonia) and thousands of transactions designed to prevent the onward tracing of the misappropriated funds. Millions of dollars of the fraud proceeds were transferred to parties around the world, with the major part to bank accounts in Russia (USD 200 million), Moldova (USD 95 million), Estonia (USD 58 million) and Cyprus (USD 41 million). It is likely that these transfers at least in part lead to further laundering mechanisms which require further analysis.</p>\r\n<p>Kroll continues to work together with international supervisory authorities to unravel the money laundering structure and identify the final destinations of the fraud funds. Further investigation and detailed analysis is ongoing, in order to quantify the potential nature and extent of involvement of the other Moldovan banks. </p>\r\n<p>The tracing exercise has also identified a proportion of funds that can be traced to accounts that appear to be linked to a number of individuals in Moldova. Analysis is ongoing to clarify the end destination of the fraud proceeds and to prepare the complete list of beneficiaries, which must remain confidential to avoid negatively impacting recovery strategies.</p>\r\n<p>The next phase of investigation will include initiating legal actions to obtain orders in multiple jurisdictions to support the tracing exercise with a view to commencing recovery actions in the first half of 2017 against target individuals and organisations that benefitted from or facilitated the fraud.</p>\r\n<p>Kroll will continue to provide regular updates to the NBM during the coming months. It is important that the confidentiality of the next phase of the investigation is maintained, to maximise the opportunities for recovery.</p>",

It is the first partnership of this kind in Moldova, and the pilot-programme that gives continuity to the project will be launched on 1 January 2017, informs Moldpres.",
                "Continut": "<p>The e-procurement system has technical support from the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development.</p>\r\n<p>“The e-procurement system is meant to ensure greater transparency and efficiency of public procurement in Moldova. Our cooperation, the Finance Ministry with all entities that are part of this memorandum, will be focused on this goal,” Finance Minister Octavian Armasu said.</p>\r\n<p>“We want to implement this pilot project representing a new approach in developing the electronic public procurement system based on experience of countries from region, Ukraine and Georgia,” he said.</p>\r\n<p>Armasu also noted that according to the document, the Finance Ministry and the Public Procurement Agency became partners of private sector and civil society for developing new system. “We want to include the civil society even in elaborating the system, so that the transparency principles should be set in the system’s design, and it should enjoy greater confidence from citizens,” he said.</p>\r\n<p>He reminded that starting from 1 May 2016, a new law on public procurement entered into force. Also, a strategy on developing public procurement for 2016-2020 was adopted. New amendments to the legislation, including on creation of Agency for Dispute Resolution, will enter into force beginning with 1 January 2017.</p>\r\n<p>The creation of an efficient public procurement system represents one of fundamental elements of developing Moldova, the director of the Public Procurement Agency, Ruslan Malai, said. He noted “boosting efforts for implementing a e-procurement system will increase transparency of procurement of goods, works and services, which will lead to increasing public confidence and business environment in this system.”</p>\r\n<p>“A functional e-procurement system represents one of the most efficient instruments for increasing transparency and effectiveness of procurement procedures,” Malai said.</p>\r\n<p>Under official data, in 2014, public procurement contracts amounted to 11.54 billion lei, 10.3 per cent of GDP. In 2015, procurement of goods and services were suspended, because of lack of money. In the European countries, the public procurement quota varies between 15 and 30 per cent of GDP.</p>",

Deputy head of the Chamber of Trade and Industry of Moldova Mihai Balba said the event is held every two years and the number of Indian businessmen who take part in it is on the rise, IPN reports.<br /><br />Mihai Balba noted that bilateral meetings will be held after the business forum for the businessmen from the two states to discuss possibilities of importing medicines from India. The prices of drugs made in India are reasonable. All the pharmaceutical products are thoroughly examined and the chances for drugs of a poor quality to reach the domestic market are minimal.<br /><br />Ravi Chandar, commercial representative and consular officer of the Embassy of India in Romania, who was also accredited for Moldova, said India is a world leader in the pharmaceutical industry and 70% of the drugs made in India are generic.</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p><em>\"India produces not very costly drugs, but these are efficient because they imply low labor costs. We have enormous support for this sector. Besides being among the largest medicine producers, India is also a large consumer of drugs. Our huge population needs drugs and this opens up the pharmaceutical market of India,\"</em> stated Ravi Chandar.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>According to the Chamber of Trade and Industry of Moldova, pharmaceutical trade between Moldova and India in 2015 totaled US$310 million, as opposed to US$390 million in 2014.</p>",

                "lead": "Gross domestic product growth (GDP) for the third quarter, announced yesterday by the National Bureau of Statistics (BNS) is largely due to agriculture. BNS mentions this and the same say experts in the field.",
                "Continut": "<p>National Bureau of Statistics <a href=\"http://www.statistica.md/newsview.php?l=en&amp;id=5451&amp;idc=168\" target=\"_blank\">informs</a> that, in the third quarter of 2016 the Gross domestic product on gross series totaled 39749 mil. lei current market prices, increasing - in real terms - by 6,3% compared to quarter III of 2015. On the series seasonally adjusted, Gross domestic product increased by 7,3% compared to third quarter of 2015 and by 3,0% compared to the second quarter of 2016.</p>\r\n<p>According to the BNS, the GDP growth, was mostly influenced by agriculture, forestry and fishing (+ 4.9%) and with a share of 20.6% to the GDP creation. Wholesale and retail trade, maintenance and repair of vehicles and motorcycles (+ 0.8%), with a share of 11.9% to the GDP. Mining and manufacturing, transport and storage, information and communication (by + 0.2%), with a share of 11.7% to the GDP; 4.8% and 5.1%. The volume of taxes on products increased by 3.1% compared to the same period of the previous year, contributing to growth and GDP by 0.4%.</p>\r\n<p>Construction, public administration and defense, compulsory social security, education, health and social care had a negative impact on GDP.</p>\r\n<p>Contacted by Deschide.MD the expert in economics, Sergiu Gaibu said that the numbers displayed by BNS might be real because it is natural an economic growth to be recorded in the third quarter in comparison with the second quarter. This is due to agricultural exports. However, the increase compared to 2015 is because last year was recorded a drought, while 2016 was a productive year.</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p><em>\"So compared to the second quarter the growth is natural. This happens all the time. Compared to the third quarter of 2015 an explanation is namely that previous year was a drought and this year is a better harvest. However, the agricultural sector depends on agricultural production which was better, so it registered growth,\"</em> said Gaibu.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>The expert said that the activities of Free Economic Zones have increased their production capacities but these are insignificant if we consider the GDP growth that BNS announced.</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p><em>\"We can see a production growth in the Free Economic Zones and we mention big enterprises here. Also, in 2017 their effect will be felt. This can be appreciated, but is not due to the economy. Yes, indeed the Government established certain conditions for these companies, but they are foreign investments. So we can conclude that increased production in large enterprises has been a propelling economic growth, but the main difference is felt on agricultural plan,\"</em> the expert added.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p> </p>",

However, when examining the new draft, we found a number of integrity risks, about which we informed the government on December 15, 2016,\"</em> it is also said in the press release of the financial institution. </p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>At the same time, the World Bank representatives also say that they mentioned that, the new Package of integrity, could be a decisive factor in terms of budget support from the World Bank for Moldova in the future.</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p><em>\"We continue the dialogue with the authorities and we expect that the new law will not be approved without a significant revision. The World Bank understands the well founded concern of the civil society and will continue to support the reforms of integrity to the benefit of all citizens of Moldova,\"</em> says the World Bank.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>After it emerged multiple discussions in society on the law on the liberalization of the capital and the stimulation of tax amnesty, when the project has been presented in the parliament, the President, Adrian Candu, said that such a law can not be adopted until it is consulted with external partners, because Moldova already has an agreement with the IMF and is in dialogue with the World Bank.</p>\r\n<p>During the debate in the Parliament, Candu said that this draft law is not perfect as it is now and will be adjusted with amendments.</p>",

                "lead": "In a year when populist voters reshaped power and politics across Europe and the U.S., the world’s wealthiest people are ending 2016 with $237 billion more than they had at the start, informs Bloomberg.",
                "Continut": "<p>Triggered by disappointing economic data from China at the beginning, the U.K.’s vote to leave the European Union in the middle and the election of billionaire Donald Trump at the end, the biggest fortunes on the planet whipsawed through $4.8 trillion of daily net worth gains and losses during the year, rising 5.7 percent to $4.4 trillion by the close of trading Dec. 27, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.</p>\r\n<p>“In general, clients rode through the volatility,” said Simon Smiles, chief investment officer for ultra-high-net-worth clients at UBS Wealth Management. “2016 ended up being a spectacular year for risk assets. Pretty remarkable given the start of the year.”</p>\r\n<p>The gains were led by Warren Buffett, who added $11.8 billion during the year as his investment firm Berkshire Hathaway Inc. saw its airline and banking holdings soar after Trump’s surprise victory on Nov. 8. </p>\r\n<p>The U.S. investor reclaimed his spot as the world’s second-richest person two days after Trump’s victory ignited a year-end rally that pushed Buffett’s wealth up 19 percent for the year to $74.1 billion.</p>\r\n<p>The individual gains for the year were dominated by Americans, who had four of the five biggest increases on the index, including Microsoft Corp. co-founder Bill Gates, the world’s richest person with $91.5 billion, and oilman Harold Hamm.</p>\r\n<p>U.S. billionaires - including Buffett - favored Trump’s rival Hillary Clinton. Still, they profited from his victory when they added $77 billion to their fortunes in the post-election rally fueled by expectations that regulations would ease and American industry would benefit.</p>\r\n<p>Investors and executives welcomed Trump’s picks, including billionaire Wilbur Ross to lead the Department of Commerce and former Goldman Sachs Group Inc. executive Steven Mnuchin as his Treasury secretary, who have a combined net worth of at least $5.6 billion, according to the index.</p>\r\n<p>France’s Bernard Arnault was the sole non-American representative among the five best performers, adding $7.1 billion to take his fortune to $38.9 billion. His LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE said the Chinese luxury-goods market is improving.</p>\r\n<p>Gates remained the world’s richest person throughout the year. Amancio Ortega, Europe’s richest person and founder of the Zara clothing chain, was in second place on the index for most of the year until he ceded it to Buffett in November. Ortega, who dropped $1.7 billion in 2016, is the world’s third-richest person with $71.2 billion.</p>\r\n<p>Wildcatter Hamm’s fortune was propelled by a strengthening oil price and expectations a Trump administration will slash fossil-fuel regulations. Hamm added $8.4 billion to more than double his fortune to $15.3 billion. </p>\r\n<p>Amazon.com Inc. founder Jeff Bezos, who doubled his fortune to $60 billion in 2015, led gains among technology executives again this year, rising $7.5 billion in 2016 on robust sales growth at the online retailer. He was followed by Facebook Inc. co-founder Mark Zuckerberg, who added $5.4 billion.</p>\r\n<p><strong>China has 31 billionaires on the index with $262 billion, trailing the U.S.. which has 179 billionaires who control $1.9 trillion, and Germany, whose 39 individuals have $281 billion. Russian billionaires also began to put the negative effects of U.S. and European sanctions behind them, reversing the combined $63 billion declines for 2014 and 2015 and adding $49 billion in 2016.</strong></p>\r\n<p>Source: <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-12-28/as-populists-won-2016-ballots-world-s-richest-made-237-billion\">Bloomberg</a></p>",

                "lead": "The governor of the National Bank of Moldova Sergiu Cioclea considers the year ends better than it started. The exchange rate of the leu has stabilized this year. Inflation decreased, while the economy shows signs of recovery. The base rate, which is a thermometer of the economy, was cut from 19.5% to 9%. The statements were made in an interview for Radio Free Europe.",
                "Continut": "<blockquote>\r\n<p><em>\"So, as a doctor, I would say that the conditions of convalescence are present. Now the banking system surely reacts to the improvements in the business sector with a particular delay. In fact, in 2016 we see the problems accumulated in 2014-2015, which were difficult years, in the balance of the banks. First of all, there was a powerful drought in that period. The interest rates increased a lot and lending activity diminished. This is a big problem as lending is the main function of the banks,\"</em> the governor stated.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>Sergiu Cioclea believes 2016 was a turning point for the banking system because the reforms initiated by the previous administration ultimately acquired a systemic framework in the agreement with the International Monetary Fund. “If we manage to do what we aim by this accord, I assure you that 2016 and 2017 will be years of real transformation of the Moldovan banking system,” he said.<br /><br />As to the three banks that are under special supervision, the governor said that at the end of 2015 these were controlled by independent teams. There were carried out so-called diagnosis studies that revealed all kinds of problems. These banks proposed remedying plans that were validated by the National Bank of Moldova and are now being implemented. All the three are now in a period of convalescence.<br /><br />In another development, Sergiu Cioclea said it is regrettable that Moldova took part in that ‘Russian laundry,’ alongside many other countries, including EU ones, where the mechanisms for fighting money laundering should have worked much better than in Moldova. “We must admit out mistakes and should not singularize ourselves in this global problem,” he stated.</p>\r\n<p>Source: I<a href=\"http://www.ipn.md/ro/economie\">PN</a></p>",

The request to diminish the size of the loan was made by the Polish side.",

The contracts are signed by Polish entrepreneurs and Moldovan businessmen and are approved by the ministries of finance of the two states.<br /><br />However, from the very beginning, even if the lending conditions were described as very good by the Ministry of Finance of Moldova (interest rate of 2%), the borrowed amount was distributed with difficulty. At different meetings, businessmen said this was due to the bureaucratic obstacles faced in accessing the loan.<br /><br />Since the agreement was signed, six of the 26 applications submitted by enterprises, to the value of about €10 million, have been accepted. The Ministry of Finance of Poland approved five of these.</p>\r\n<p>Source: <a href=\"http://ipn.md/\">IPN</a></p>",

                "lead": "The Executive Committee of the National Bank yesterday decided to keep the policy rate that was established at the end of October. Thus the base rate applied on the main short-term monetary policy remains at 9.0 percent annually.",
                "Continut": "<p>At the same time, it maintains the interest rates on overnight loans at the current level of 12.0 percent annually and on overnight deposits at the current level of 6.0 percent annually.</p>\r\n<p>NBM maintains the required reserves ratio from financial means attracted in freely convertible currency at the level of 14.0 percent of the base as well as the required reserves ratio from financial means attracted in MDL and non-convertible currency at the current level of 35.0 percent of the base.</p>\r\n<p>The analysis of the most recent statistic data shows a slight increase of the annual inflation rate, being for the third consecutive month below the lower limit of the range of ± 1.5 percentage points from the 5.0 percent target.</p>\r\n<p>The annual inflation rate was 2.6 percent in November 2016, by 0.1 percentage points more compared to the previous month.</p>\r\n<p>The annual inflation rate is in line with the latest forecast of the NBM (published in October 2016) and validates the correctness of monetary policy decisions taken in 2015 and at the beginning of the year.</p>\r\n<p>The annual rate of core inflation was 5.6 percent in November 2016, decreasing by 0.3 percentage points compared to the previous month.</p>\r\n<p>In the third quarter of 2016, GDP increased by 6.3 percent and continued the positive evolution recorded in the first quarter of this year. In terms of uses, the economic growth was due to the increase in internal and external demand.    Thus, the increase in exports, final household consumption and gross fixed capital formation generated contributions of 5.9, 4.2 and 0.9 percentage points, respectively. By categories of resources, the positive evolution of GDP was determined by the increase of gross value added in all sectors, except for that of the subcomponent \"construction\", \"public administration\" and \"other activities\". Thus, the gross value added recorded increases in \"agriculture\" (24.2 percent), \"trade\" (6.8 percent), \"transport and storage\" (3.3 percent), \"information and communications\" (2.9 percent) and \"industry\" (1.2 percent).</p>\r\n<p>The dynamic of macroeconomic indicators in October and November 2016 shows mixed evolutions of the economic activity in the fourth quarter of 2016. In October 2016, the exports increased by 6.6 percent compared to the same period of 2015, imports by 12.8 percent and industrial output recorded a level of minus 2.2 percent. At the same time, the transport of goods increased by 0.3 percent, trade in services by 0.8 percent, while retail trade decreased by 2.5 percent.</p>\r\n<p>In terms of consumer demand, the annual average real wage growth in the economy was 9.2 percent in October 2016, by 2.3 percentage points higher than in September 2016. Money transfers to individuals through the banks of the Republic of Moldova fell by 4.4 percent in January-November 2016, while in November 2016, these transfers increased by 0.9 percent, in nominal terms, compared with the same periods of 2015.</p>\r\n<p>In November 2016, lending and saving processes recorded similar developments. The volume of new loans granted during the reporting period increased by 8.5 percent, while new attracted deposits increased by 0.7 percent compared to the same period of last year. However, the total balance of credits decreased by 7.3 percent at the end of November 2016, while total balance of deposits recorded an increase of 4.0 percent than at the end of November 2015.</p>\r\n<p>The average rate of new loans granted in national currency decreased by 0.49 percentage points compared to the level recorded in October 2016, accounting for 12.56 percent. The rate of new deposits attracted in MDL increased in November 2016 by 0.24 percentage points, reaching the level of 7.48 percent.</p>\r\n<p>The monetary policy conduct continues to be affected by the risks and uncertainties associated with the development of internal and external environment. The external inflationary risks are associated with the increase in international food, oil and natural gas prices, along with the fluctuations in the financial markets. Potential internal risks and uncertainties to inflation arise from the existence of liquidity excess, the impact of changes in excise duties related to fiscal policy for 2017 and harvest in 2017, respectively. At the same time, the Republic of Moldova - Turkey Free Trade Agreement, together with the abolishment of custom duty on import of some products from Ukraine, the reinclusion of liquefied gas price into the Methodology of formation and application of prices for oil products generate a disinflationary impact over the further inflation development. Thus, analysing the balance of risks, it is noted that the inflationary risks from the supply accelerate in the mid-forecasting period under the the persistence of disinflationary risks from the aggregate demand throughout the entire forecasting period.</p>\r\n<p>In this context, the monetary policy measures adopted by the NBM at the beginning of the year are to be transposed into the national economy through various transmission channels, including by influencing interest rates on loans and deposits in national currency, thus exerting further effects on inflation development.</p>\r\n<p>Against this background, within the meeting held on 29 December 2016, the members of the Executive Board of the NBM decided by unanimous vote to maintain the policy rate at the current level of 9.0 percent annually.</p>\r\n<p>The decision is aimed at maintaining the inflation rate close to the target of 5.0 percent over the medium-term, with a possible deviation of ± 1.5 percentage points. The gradual calibration of monetary policy conduct aims to ensure adequate real monetary conditions for supporting the lending and savings and for boosting the domestic demand, along with further adaptation of domestic economic environment to the volatility and uncertainty related to external environment.</p>\r\n<p>NBM will continue to manage firmly the liquidity excess through sterilization operations, according to the announced schedule.</p>\r\n<p>At the same time, National Bank will continue to offer banks liquidity, according to the schedule announced for 2017, through REPO operations with the term of 14 days, at a fixed rate equal to the base rate of the National Bank plus a margin of 0.25 points percentage.</p>\r\n<p>NBM will further monitor and anticipate the domestic and international economic environment developments, so that by the flexibility of operational framework specific for the inflation targeting strategy to ensure price stability in the medium term.</p>\r\n<p>The next meeting of the Executive Board of the NBM on monetary policy will take place on 26 January 2017, according to the announced schedule.</p>",

                "lead": "The Ministry of Economy drafted a bill to amend and supplement the Law on Limited Liability Companies. The proposed amendments regulate the obtaining of an inherited capital share in a limited liability company, if the capacity of associate of the new shareholder is rejected by the associates of the Ltd.",
                "Continut": "<p>The Constitutional Court, which examined the existing relevant regulations, ruled there may be cases when the capacity of new associate of the shareholder is rejected by the associates of the Ltd given that the limited liability company is founded and works based on the will and mutual confidence of associates. But the rejection should not affect the property right of the one that obtains capital shares, this being entitled to get the equivalent in money of the shareholding.</p>\r\n<p>Thus, the bill proposed by the Ministry of Economy provides that for the changes concerning the obtaining of capital shares to be included in the State Register of Legal Entities, the new shareholder will present the share acquisition document authenticated by the notary to the State Registration Chamber. The modified act on the founding of the Ltd and the decision of the general assembly of shareholders are not required.</p>\r\n<p>In other words, the Ministry of Economy, by this bill, aims to ensure the protection of the rights of Ltd associates and of the new shareholder, enabling this to ask for the equivalent in money of the shareholding, without too many bureaucratic barriers and without needing to present the changes made to the founding act.</p>\r\n<p>The bill is to be examined and approved by the Government and passed by Parliament.</p>\r\n<p>Source: <a href=\"http://ipn.md/\">IPN.</a></p>",

                "Continut": "<p>The World Bank estimates a growth of 3.3 percent in 2018 and 3.7 percent in 2019 for the Moldovan economy in the same report. The prospects for 2017 – 2019 are above average for the region. On the other hand, estimates for further years were revised to get lower by 1.2 percentage points.</p>\r\n<p>World Bank predicts for Europe and Central Asia region, which includes the Republic of Moldova, economic growth averaged to 2.4 per cent in 2017, 2.8 per cent in 2018 and 2.9 per cent in 2019.</p>\r\n<p>For 2016 the economic growth forecast for Moldova was 2.2%, the country recovering from the recession recorded in 2015.</p>\r\n<p>The World Bank experts noted that the economic advance in 2016 was supported, partially, by an easier re-launch registered in the Russian Federation and Ukraine, which is closely related to Moldovan economy. Similarly, the report notes that it could have a negative effect by reducing the flow of remittances and lower exports demand. The budget for 2017 was built on an economic growth of 3.0 per cent, an inflation rate of 4.4 per cent and an exchange rate of about 20.00 lei per dollar.</p>\r\n<p>According to WB’s report, the Russian economy will grow by 1.5 and 1.7 per cent during 2017 and 2018, Ukrainian – by 2.0 and 3.0 per cent, while Romania will register an advance of 3.7 and 3.4 per cent.</p>\r\n<p>Deschide.MD recalls that Minister of Economy, Octavian Calmic, during a press conference, said that in 2016 was recorded an economic growth of over 3%, which means about 1% higher than the forecasts made at the beginning of the year by IMF, World Bank, Economy Ministry, and also experts. He also said that this trend must be maintained for 2017.</p>",

                "lead": "The European Commission has today granted a request by the Republic of Moldova by proposing a Macro-Financial Assistance (MFA) programme of up to EUR 100 million. The proposed assistance would help the country meet its short-term financing needs, informs the press release of the European Commission.",
                "Continut": "<p>Up to EUR 40 million of the MFA would be provided in grants and up to EUR 60 million in medium-term loans at favourable financing conditions.</p>\r\n<p>The new assistance would be disbursed in three instalments in 2017 and 2018.</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p><em>\"Moldova's recent efforts to pursue stability-oriented policies and tackle long-standing vulnerabilities must be sustained. Today the Commission is providing further support for the country as it works to preserve macroeconomic stability, improve governance and achieve more sustainable and inclusive growth,\" </em>said Pierre Moscovici, Commissioner for Economic and Financial Affairs, Taxation and Customs.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>In turn, Valdis Dombrovskis, Vice President of the European Commission declared that European funding will encourage Moldova in realization of \"vital reforms\".</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p><em>\"This assistance will help Moldova meet its most immediate financing needs and stabilise its economy. At the same time, we are confident that the conditions related to this financing will contribute to improving economic governance in the country and encourage vital reforms,\" </em>said Vice-President for the Euro and Social Dialogue, also in charge of Financial Stability, Financial Services and Capital Markets Union.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>The Republic of Moldova faces many challenges, notably the need to tackle corruption and poor governance, which have contributed to a weakening of the fiscal and balance of payments positions and a slowdown in economic growth, and to thoroughly investigate the massive banking fraud that hit the country's economy in 2014. Economic difficulties have been exacerbated by weak economic activity in some of Moldova's key regional trading partners. This effect has been partly offset by increased trade with the EU, which can be linked to the Association Agreement that entered into force on 1 July 2016 and created a Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Area (DCFTA).</p>\r\n<p>The proposed EU MFA requires adoption by the European Parliament and the Council before it can come into effect and disbursements can be made.</p>\r\n<p>It would accompany the country's new IMF programme, approved on 7 November 2016.</p>\r\n<p>Specifically, the MFA would help Moldova to cover part of its external financing needs over the coming two years. The operation would therefore contribute to reducing the economy's short-term balance of payments and fiscal vulnerabilities.</p>\r\n<p>Disbursements under the proposed MFA programme would be strictly conditional on good progress with the IMF programme and on the implementation of specific policy conditionality to be agreed between Moldova and the EU in a Memorandum of Understanding.</p>\r\n<p>These policy conditions would address some of the fundamental weaknesses of the Moldovan economy and economic governance system, notably in the banking sector.</p>\r\n<p>This would be done in close coordination with the adjustment and reform programmes Moldova has agreed with the IMF and the World Bank, as well as with the reforms agreed in the context of the EU's budgetary support operations and the DCFTA agreement.</p>\r\n<p>Macro-Financial Assistance is an exceptional EU crisis response instrument available to the EU's neighbouring partner countries. It is complementary to assistance provided by the IMF. MFA loans are financed through EU borrowing on capital markets. The funds are then on-lent with similar financial terms to the beneficiary countries. MFA grants come from the EU budget.</p>\r\n<p>The MFA assistance is meant to complement a new programme, approved by the IMF Board on 7 November 2016, agreed between the Republic of Moldova and the International Monetary Fund (IMF).</p>\r\n<p>A previous MFA to the Republic of Moldova, amounting to EUR 90 million, all in grants, was successfully implemented in 2010-2012.</p>\r\n<p>Source: <a href=\"http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-17-40_en.htm\" target=\"_blank\">europa.eu</a></p>",

                "Continut": "<p>At his meeting with the Russian enterprise leadership on Tuesday within his official visit to Moscow, Dodon said that Chisinau is studying possible variants of repaying the mainland Moldova’s debt that reaches around US$500 million.</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p><em>“There are certain preliminary plans for resolving this situation. The mainland Moldova’s debt is of nearly US$500 million, while Transnistria’s debt – nearly US$6 billion. We have to understand that the whole debt – more than US$6.5 million – is Moldova’s total debt”</em>, Dodon said.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>According to him, Gazprom enterprise does not divide the Transnistria’s debt from Moldova’s total debt.</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p><em>“As for the mainland Moldova debt: we proposed sources for covering it back in 2008 and we will return to this scheme. It includes a part of assets, which are today used by Moldovagaz, but they have not been included in this company’s authorized capital”</em>, the President said, adding that Moldova cannot resolve the problem with Transnistria’s debt at the current stage.</p>\r\n<p><em>“This issue should be considered in the general context of Transnistria’s settlement”</em>, Igor Dodon said.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>Infotag’s dossier: Gazprom owns 50% of shares plus one share in the Moldovagaz joint-stock company. Since the moment of company foundation, local authorities have laid local gas pipelines, which were not included in Moldovagaz balance. According to preliminary assessment, their cost is estimated at 1.5-1.8 billion lei, which was proposed to be included in Moldovagaz authorized capital and raise the Moldova’s share in the company, which accounts for around 34%, at the amount of this sum, or to repay current debts for gas to Gazprom.</p>\r\n<p>Source: <a href=\"http://www.infotag.md/economics-en/238272/\" target=\"_blank\">Infotag</a></p>",

Moldova-EU Association Agreement, to which you refer is in place for a relatively short period of time. I think since mid 2014. There were a lot of different factors that have an impact on Moldova's economy, both internal and external, which, I think, complicates the assessment of the benefits of this Agreement. <strong>As for the part with the IMF in your question, again, just to remind people that the IMF approved an agreement with Moldova worth 178.7 million US dollars, funded by the Extended Fund Facility (EFF) and extended credit Facility (ECF). And we are still at the stage of discussion of the next steps of the program. The Moldovan authorities have engaged in achieving economic reform program supported by the IMF. Here, I want to make just a clarification, for the first evaluation mission, as I mentioned under the Programme, it will be between 14 to 28 February. The mission will discuss with the authorities and will review the program implementation</strong>,\" said Gerry Rice, the Director of the Department of Communications (COM), of the International Monetary Fund</em></p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>So, from what you say nothing has changed? insisted the Russian journalist.</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>\"No. I think we have to wait for the mission to reach the land and to keep a dialogue with the authorities and, of course, as usual we will have the statements, \"said Gerry Rice.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>We remind you that President Igor Dodon <a href=\"/en/news/political/7153/Dodon-after-meeting-with-Tusk-I-announced-that-I'll-support-the-cancellation-of-the-AA-with-EU.htm\" target=\"_blank\">stated</a> during his meeting with European Council President Donald Tusk that the Association Agreement between Moldova and the European Union could be terminated due to a possible referendum or parliamentary elections, at the same time, the president mentioned that he pleads for trilateral negotiations: EU-Republic of Moldova-Russian Federation regarding the trade.</p>",

                "lead": "Following the theft economists had feared the worst, especially since two of Moldova’s biggest trading partners, Ukraine and Russia, were mired in financial crises of their own. Yet since then the country has coped remarkably well. GDP shrank by a mere 0.5% in 2015 (whereas Russia’s fell by 4% and Ukraine’s tanked by 10%). Last year Moldova grew by 2%, fast by European standards.",
                "Continut": "<p>Some credit must go to the government, which swiftly offered a blanket guarantee of deposits. The state in effect issued debt to cover every deposit in banks that failed. Moldova’s government finances look a little shakier as a result. But neither households nor companies have lost money directly. The government’s intervention has thus propped up consumption and investment. The tills at MallDova, a shopping mall in the capital, are still ringing.<br /><a class=\"smallbox\" href=\"http://www.economist.com/news/europe/21717044-leaked-report-revealed-2014-up-1bn-equivalent-more-one-eighth\" target=\"_blank\">--</a></p>\r\n<p>The odd structure of the Moldovan economy also helped. It is heavily agricultural: about a third of workers are farmers. Most are smallholders. Few borrow much from banks, so few have noticed that credit has grown tighter. Good weather played a part: following dry conditions in 2015 cereal production rose by a third last year. A free-trade agreement with the EU in 2014 provides a ready market for Moldovan commodities, including its delicious wine.</p>\r\n<p>Money sent back by Moldovan emigrants may have also softened the blow. Moldova is about twice as dependent on remittances as the Philippines, which is saying something. Though the flow has slowed, the weakness of the Moldovan leu ensures that expats sending money from the EU get a good deal.</p>\r\n<p>Problems remain. Even the poshest areas of Chisinau have pockmarked roads and poor lighting. Corruption is rampant (though the IMF is helping the government to fight it), 15% of Moldovans are poor and higher government debt means fiscal policy will be tight. But for a place that usually makes the news for the wrong reasons, a glimmer of hope is about as good as it gets.</p>\r\n<p>MOLDOVA is a country of ignominious records. It is by far Europe’s poorest place. Among countries that bother to count foreign tourists, only Tuvalu welcomes fewer. To these dubious achievements, this little Romanian-speaking former Soviet republic added a new one in 2014. A leaked report revealed that up to $1bn, equivalent to more than an eighth of the country’s GDP, had been stolen from three banks. Relative to the size of its economy, that may be the biggest bank fraud of all time. What happened next, however, was surprising.</p>\r\n<p>Source: <a href=\"http://www.economist.com/news/europe/21717044-leaked-report-revealed-2014-up-1bn-equivalent-more-one-eighth\" target=\"_blank\">The Economist</a></p>",

Several irregularities were identified, most of them on hygienic-sanitary order,\"</em> told us the source.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>In total, the Russian experts have verified the following companies:</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p><strong>1) „KVINT”;</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>2) KAZAYAK-VIN;</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>3) SA „Cricova”; </strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>4) „Bulgari Winery”;</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>5) „Золотой Аист” (Barza de Aur);</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>6) „Молдавский стандарт” (Moldovian Standard);</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>7) „Chateau Vartely”;</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>8) „Nexovin”;</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>9) „Moldiugvin”;</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>10) „Aurnecvin”;</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>11) „CASTEL MIMI”;</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>12) „Spirits and Distilled Trade”;</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>13) „Lion-Gri”.</strong></p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>We specify that in an interview with Deschide.MD - which will appear shortly - the Minister of Economy, Octavian Calmac said that the Rospotrebnadzor has already presented some preliminary results, according to which over 10 companies that produce alcoholic beverages were evaluated and will be placed on the list of companies eligible to export to the Russian market.</p>\r\n<p>We remind you that the Russian authorities have banned more than once the Moldovan wines products, without present, however, evidence or arguments about the decision made. The latest restrictions on Moldovan wines were imposed in autumn 2013.</p>\r\n<p>Subsequently, the embargo was canceled only for a few companies from the Transnistrian region. Following the imposition of the embargo in 2013, our country producers incurred losses of 20 million dollars and turned to other markets.</p>",

He built a dream around this passion for history and architecture and his intention is to revive an \"Antique Island\" in the heart of today's Europe. He stays confident that such a project deserves to be implemented in the Carpathian Mountains, in Romania, especially considering that the history of Romania is inseparable from the heritage of the vast territories of the former Roman Empire. With such a ‘pearl’ in its cultural and tourist background, Romania will be able to regain its glory as one of the oldest and most majestic corners of Europe.",

It is for this reason that the idea deserves its fulfillment in Romania - a country that must reaffirm its ambitions of a strong and respected state. </p>\r\n<p> <em>„Such a project will make Romania, visited by millions of people, a dream country, and its citizens will no longer be seen only as cheap human resource”,</em> says Vladimir Russu, continuing his thought, that even the Romanian authorities would encounter great admiration if they directed their initiatives and efforts towards the implementation of this extraordinary concept. </p>\r\n<p>The \"Small Antique City\" will be surrounded by hundreds of hectares of Lebanese cedars, a rare tree of special symbolism that can be found in almost all royal courts. The main feature of this tree is that it stays green all year round. </p>\r\n<p><em>\n\t <div align=\"center\"> \t\t<div class=\"cs_img cs_fl_right\"  style=\"width:315.5px;\">\n\t\t\t <p><a href=\"/images/cms-image-000104624.png\" class=\"photoViewer\" title=\"\"> \t\t\t\t<img src=\"/get_img?ImageRatio=25&amp;ImageWidth=315&amp;ImageHeight=211&amp;ImageId=104624\" alt=\"The concept of the island\"  border=\"0\"/>\n\t\t\t </a></p> \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n“Once being in this 'oasis' of antiquity, you will feel yourself traveling in time. The rhythm of life, garments, behavior, menu - everything will be like in those days\", </em>enthusiastically states Mr. Vladimir Russu. </p>\r\n<p>Residential villas, in the same Doric style, will be located in the cedar forest itself. </p>\r\n<p><em>“People who buy or rent a villa there will be surrounded by tranquility, peace and solitude, in order to fully enjoy the royal calm and comfort that reigns in a cedar forest. In addition, I plan for the resort to have the most advanced spa services in the world, this place will be truly unrivaled.” </em>continues on his idea Mr. Russu. </p>\r\n<p>By promoting such a project, Romania will represent significant advantages for European funds, and after the construction of the entire complex, it will undoubtedly become a unique landmark, on international scale. </p>\r\n<p><em> </em><em>“There is a great bulk of tourism potential in Romania, that is currently not developed at all. The planning and implementation of such a large-scale and promising project would certainly reposition Romania to the status of a country with popular tourist attractions and would include it in the league of countries with a highly-developed level of tourism.</em></p>\r\n<p><em>\n\t <div align=\"center\"> \t\t<div class=\"cs_img cs_fl_left\"  style=\"width:310px;\">\n\t\t\t <p><a href=\"/images/cms-image-000104625.png\" class=\"photoViewer\" title=\"\"> \t\t\t\t<img src=\"/get_img?ImageRatio=25&amp;ImageWidth=310&amp;ImageHeight=207&amp;ImageId=104625\" alt=\"The concept of the island\"  border=\"0\"/>\n\t\t\t </a></p> \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\nContemporary trends in this area are directed towards vacations and leisure with elements of entertainment, and even adventure, as well as for visiting places with rare symbols. Only with beautiful views and wild forests, as today in the region of the river Prut, there is no way to direct huge flows of tourists to this region.”,</em> concludes the President of ACCENT GROUP.</p>\r\n<p>The overall forecasted investment in the project is about one billion euros, and Vladimir Russu has already begun an active search for partners, investors and funds to make his dream come true. </p>\r\n<p><em> </em><em>“The beautiful and harmonious architecture of Ancient Rome has survived only on historical sites, some are even in ruins, that have remained over time. These treasures will also be lost to humanity. I believe that the moral duty of today's generation is to preserve and pass on this heritage.”, </em>asserts Mr. Russu. </p>\r\n<p>The noble shapes and forms of Ancient Rome architecture evoke delight and admiration, they amaze with their exquisite lines and wonderful details, but unfortunately only some of them retain the previous authentic elements, in all their complexity.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Main achievements of ACCENT GROUP Construction Company:</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>\n\t <div align=\"center\"> \t\t<div class=\"cs_img cs_fl_right\"  style=\"width:322.5px;\">\n\t\t\t <p><a href=\"/images/cms-image-000104633.jpg\" class=\"photoViewer\" title=\"\"> \t\t\t\t<img src=\"/get_img?ImageRatio=25&amp;ImageWidth=322&amp;ImageHeight=344&amp;ImageId=104633\"   border=\"0\"/>\n\t\t\t </a></p> \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\nVladimir Russu is a business executive, who regards the situation and its perspectives on a full and comprehensive scale, so his group of companies, in general, and in particular the construction company, developed projects that at first seemed impossible to realize.</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong> For example, Granit Imobil, a subsidiary of ACCENT GROUP, has built one of the most complex buildings in Chisinau: The Financial and Business Center, located on bd. Stefan cel Mare, 171/1. This is a semi-cylindrical-structured construction, with more than a half of its upper level areas supported by a single column. The Residential complex \"Ambasador\" is another gem in the portfolio of the construction company Granit Imobil, and these are just a few of the turnkey A+ building projects that Vladimir Russu is very proud of, and is enthusiastically and actively promoting even more interesting projects for the future.</strong></p>\r\n<div><strong><br /></strong></div>",
