Witnesses who broadcasted the video said that he was drunk. Police from Dubasari noticed this case and they quoted the diplomat for hearings. In turn, the Russian Embassy strongly denied the information published in the media about their representative, claiming that the one who filmed were those who disturbed public order. Also, the Embassy said that the incident took place at a recreation center on the Dniester bank and the police interfered to calm everyone, this information being denied by police.</p>\r\n<p>Details: <a href=\"http://beta.deschide.md/ro/news/social/30659/Show-%E2%80%9Ediplomatic%E2%80%9D-rusesc-la-Molovata-Poli%C5%A3ia-cere-ajutorul-martorilor.htm\">Show „diplomatic” rusesc la Molovata.

Many shouted \"thieves!\" and \"shame on you!\" as President Nicolae Timofti and other officials laid floral wreaths at a monument honoring Stephen the Great, a 15th-century Moldovan hero.</p>\r\n<p>Few citizens were permitted to enter the square amid heavy police security. No injuries from Saturday's clashes were reported.</p>\r\n<p>Underlining tensions, Timofti said in a speech earlier Saturday that Moldova's independence and security were undermined by the presence of \"foreign military forces that are on the country's territory against the wishes of the population.\"</p>\r\n<p>He was referring to the presence of 1,000 Russian peacekeepers in the pro-Russian separatist enclave of Trans-Dniester in eastern Moldova.</p>\r\n<p>Trans-Dniester broke away from Moldova in 1990 amid fears that it wanted to reunite with Romania, which Moldova was part of until 1940. Some 1,500 died in a war in 1992 between Moldovans and separatists.</p>\r\n<p>European Union member Romania has a close relationship with Moldova. Romanian President Klaus Iohannis said Saturday the day was an occasion to \"support projects which seek to improve the lives of all Moldovan citizens and fulfil their European destiny.\"</p>\r\n<p>Moldova, sandwiched between Romania and Ukraine, declared independence on Aug. 27, 1991, as the Soviet Union unraveled.</p>\r\n<p>The economically struggling nation depends on Russia for most of its gas. Figures published this week found that more than a quarter of Moldova's citizens have emigrated for work, and more than half of them work in Russia.</p>\r\n<p>Source: <a href=\"http://www.foxnews.com/world/2016/08/27/protests-tear-gas-at-moldova-independence-day-parade.html\" target=\"_blank\">Fox News</a></p>",

This is the opinion of the Ukrainian attorney Alexei Shevchuk.</strong></p>\r\n<p>Today, during  the press conference in Kiev, Alexei Shevchuk stated that numerous violations had been committed  in Platon’s case.</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>“<em>Only my defendant has the information about the theft of the billion from the banking system. He wanted to protect the Republic of Moldova and its citizens; he wanted to inform the international community about the iniquities in Moldova. He was ready to confess everything to Ukrainian authorities about how the billion had been stolen. Veaceslav Kobalev knew that he would be under political pressure, but he was not scared</em>”,  Alexei Shevchuk declared.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>The Russian attorney Ilya Novikov – who earlier defended the interests of the Ukrainian pilot Nadya Savchenko – claims that the extradition process of Veaceslav Platon is based upon hidden interests of Ukrainian and Moldovan decision markers.</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>“<em>The most important argument of prosecutors is the missing document, confirming the issue of the identity card on Veaceslav Platon’s name. There are competent authorities, which shall verify the legality of documents; however we witnessed a rapid process of examination and extradition of Mr. Kobalev. I am certain that without a political agreement, such procedure of extradition would not be possible. I have a great deal of respect for the Ukrainian President, Petro Poroshenko. I would request the President to demand necessary security measures to be ensured for Mr. Kobalev in the Moldovan penitentiary</em>”, Ilya Novikov stated.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/U3IEzZskKJs\" width=\"610\" height=\"343\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></p>\r\n<p>We remind you that Veaceslav Platon, arrested by the Ukrainian authorities at the request of Moldovan prosecutors, was extradited to theRepublicofMoldovalast night. He is under criminal investigation for fraud and money laundering in large proportions, leading to an over 800 million lei damage to Banca de Economii  .</p>\r\n<p>On July 25<sup>th</sup> , an arrest warrant for 30 days was issued on the name of Veaceslav Platon  and he is wanted internationally. Exactly on the same day, the so called “No. 1 raider of CIS”, Veaceslav Platon, was arrested by the Ukrainian authorities in Kiev.</p>",

We are conducting many penal actions in order to update the content of other files in which he might be involved. Beforehand I can say that there are three more cases in which we are investigating a possible involvement of this citizen, but for now he does not have any status in them. The prosecutors are working on building up evidence, which will allow accusing him on other crimes. More specifically we will talk on this subject most probably next week after we sum up all gathered information\", </em>stated Viorel Morari.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>We remind that Veaceslav Platon was extradited on the Monday to the Republic of Moldova. On Tuesday, the Buiucani Court was about to consider the prosecutors' requirement on the prolongation of the arrest warranty, however, the hearing was postponed at the prosecutors' request.</p>\r\n<p>Platon has been escorted by masked men, being handcuffed. Passing by journalists he managed to state that \"He is not guilty of anything\", \"All the money stole Vlad Plahotniuc\" and that he needs a \"toothbrush, clothes, shorts, sneakers and something to eat\".</p>\r\n<p>Veaceslav Platon is criminally investigated for fraud and money laundering in huge proportions, fact which damaged the Banca de Economii with over 800 million lei.  </p>\r\n<p>The prosecutors concluded that the money, obtained through deception as credits, were transferred on the accounts of some offshore companies, to conceal its illegal origin, and later, a part of it was used for extinguishing some credits in the banks from the Republic of Moldova.</p>",

Platon submitted a request on the name of the prosecutor Andrei Baiesu, through his lawyer, Ana Ursachi, who thought on this occasion that men of the law should consider the statements of her client.",
                "Continut": "<blockquote>\r\n<p><em> \"For 12 days, since he is in the 13<sup>th </sup>Penitentiary, Veaceslav Platon was not heard by any prosecutor\"</em>, mentioned in this context Ursachi. </p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>The Attorney claims that <em>\"Platon is not remanded for his involvement in the billion theft, but for a transaction when Plahotniuc sold shares from «Victoriabank»”</em>, a 80 billion dollars transaction, <em>\"although, the prosecutors found only 49 billion dollars\"</em>.</p>\r\n<p>According to the lawyer, his client states that the final beneficiary of the bank thefts would be Vladimir Plahotniuc. </p>\r\n<p>During the same press conference, the Russian advocate Ilia Novikov mentioned that, while the Platon's extradition can not be cancelled, the court from the Republic of Moldova can consider the fact that his client was extradited illegally.</p>\r\n<p>Novikov also said that he was transported from Ukraine to Moldova with a private jet, with 12 seats, and his extradition was extraordinary fast, that is fueling suspicion that there were made some deals at the structural level between Moldovan and Ukrainian sides. At the same time,  the lawyer does not subscribe to the allegations appeared on the public space, according to which there was a direct agreement between Vladimir Plahotniuc and the Ukrainian President, Petro Poroshenko. </p>\r\n<p>At the same press conference, Novikov mentioned that, after Shor's testimonies against Platon, the Mayor from Orhei was transferred in house arrest. The attorney does not exclude therefore that there was an agreement between prosecutors and Ilan Shor regarding his testimonies and his transfer from the solitary to house arrest.</p>\r\n<p>The advocate also said that at the moment he is seeking for support from the EU Diplomacy, US Diplomacy and Russian Federation Diplomacy, because he has a Russian citizenship: <em>\"An official of the Russian Embassy can visit him in the solitary, because Platon is also a Russian citizen\"</em>. </p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p><em>\"Only the simple presence of a diplomat in the court room would make judges to do the right thing\"</em>, mentioned Novicov.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>We remind you that Platon was wanted internationally on July 25<sup>th</sup>, on his name was issued an arrest warrant for 30 days. Exactly in the same day, \"the Nr.1 Raider from CIS\" was arrested in Kiev by Ukrainian Authorities. Afterwards, the Ukrainian court issued an arrest warrant for 40 days on his name, time used for his extradition procedure. </p>\r\n<p>The arrest warrant was issued by Authorities from Chisinau, after the prosecutors searched and have raised documents from different banks, at some offices, as well as at the houses of some individuals, inclusively after Shor's self-denouncement, who specified that he gave to Platon credits from BEM, that have not been paid back. The measures were taken during an extended inquiry file regarding the banking fraud. According to the men of the law, this case has connections to another case regarding laundering of 20 billion dollars through a Moldovan bank.</p>",

                "lead": "The Romanian Government decided to continue financing the construction and renovation of the Moldovan kindergartens. This was discussed last night at an event organised by the Romanian Embassy, where the results of the implementation of the Financial and Technical Assistance Program offered by the Romanian Government for the construction and renovation of the preschool institutions from our country, were summed up. During this Program, 832 kindergartens from all the districts of the Republic of Moldova were repaired.",
                "Continut": "<p>The Prime-Minister Pavel Filip mentioned that the financial assistance offered by Romania is very important for our country and offered the opportunity for thousands of children to learn in up-to-date conditions, and for other thousands employees to work in better work conditions. At the same time, Pavel Filip highly appreciated the decision of the Romanian Government to continue the project in the year of 2016, offering additional three billion euros, as a grant, for the reparation of another 85 kindergartens from Moldova. </p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p><em>\"The relations between the states are often considered abstract, but in this case, we have the example of some projects that were realized in very important fields for society. The offered assistance, proves us one more time that Romania was and remains the most consequent supporter of Moldova\", noted the Prime-Minister, Pavel Filip.  </em> </p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>At the same time the Prime-Minister spoke about the importance of the development of the educational system and offering to the young generation the opportunity to develop their professional skills, that is a priority for the Moldovan Government, which will continue to invest in this sector. <em>\"The children are our future, but for them it must become present, not future. Let's build together the future of our children\"</em>, concluded Pavel Filip.</p>\r\n<p>In turn, the Romanian Ambassador in Chisinau, Daniel Ionita, highlighted that Romania was always with the Republic of Moldova, offered support in education, as well as in other fields where the support was requested. At the same time, the Romanian diplomat said that the good results obtained during the Program, convinced the Romanian Government to continue financing the Program. </p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p><em>\"This Program does not mean only numbers, it meas first of all people. It is not important the value of 23 billion euros, it is not important even the fact that 832 preschool institutions were repaired. What is important is education, important is that every second  kindergarten from Moldova benefited from this Program, important are those over 200 thousand of beneficiaries of this Program, children that are going to European standards kindergartens, parents that can work, knowing that their children are safe, employees and teaching staff that are going to work\"</em>, emphasized Daniel Ionita. </p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>From the money offered by the Romanian Government, until today were renovated 832 kindergartens. Depending on the problems, in the institutions were repaired rooftops, installed heating systems, and built playgrounds.</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p><em>\"We have almost 240 kindergartens that were thermally insulated that leads to savings in the local and national budget\"</em>, stated the CEO of the Moldovan Social Investment Fund, Mircea Esanu.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>The Financial and Technical Assistance Program offered by the Romanian Government for the construction and renovation of the preschool institutions from the Republic of Moldova was launched in 2014 and is implemented by the Moldovan Social Investment Fund. During two years, were assigned 23 billion euros for the renovation and furnishing 832 kindergartens from all the districts of the country. </p>",

The state accusers are saying that these dossiers were begun only now, because right now other persons, detained in the files referring to those 20 milliards of dollars laundering, started to talk, and the \"puzzles\" of the infringement of the law are becoming clearer. It is about the documents, phone calls, statements of complicity, and also the answers that came from the rogatory commissions from several states.",

They understand that we do are not joking and we are going to finish this case\"</em>, specified Morari, avoiding to pronounce Platon's name or any other arrested persons. </p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>As for those four judicial executors aimed by the penal investigation, Morari states that they will have to explain why they did not collected the fees in the laundering cases, because this is the reason the state budget missed an income of 962 millions MDL, which the  judicial executors should have paid to the Government.  </p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p><em>\"It is about over 20 billions dollars, which were received after some counterfeited documents by the executors. The cases are a part of a pile of penal cases launched on the scheme of money laundering through Moldova since 2014. In the scheme are involved Ukrainians and our citizens. The scheme took place through multiple off-shore companies and<em> Russian companies. For now we do not have information about money location</em>\"</em>, stated the Chief of the Anti-Corruption Prosecutor's Office, Viorel Morari. </p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>The criminal prosecution regarding those 16 actual and ex-judges arrested yesterday by the prosecutors and anti-corruption officers started last week based on an ordinance issued by the temporary Prosecutor General, Eduard Harunjen. According to Viorel Morari, the suspects may get from 5 to 10 years of jail. All the arrested judges and executors have the status of suspect and are arrested for 72 hours, after that the decision if they will be imprisoned before trial.</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p><em>\"The undertaken actions against the judges, I want to mention that were done with the approval of the Superior Council of Magistracy. The Prosecutor General addressed a notice on this matter to the Superior Council of Magistracy and they authorized some of the addressed notices from the prosecutor general,\" </em>declared Morari. </p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>The Chief of the Criminal Prosecution Department of the CNA, Bogdan Zubreanu, stated yesterday that 51 searches were made in the offices, houses and cars of multiple judges and former judges. </p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p><em>\"The operation started at 10:00 o'clock, after the Superior Council of Magistracy has given the order, as a result of the searches in the offices of the suspects. Afterwards, to CNA were brought 15 judges and three judicial executors, who were detained for 72 hours. The operation developed without any accidents and the intervention of the special troops was not necessary. All the materials that were confiscated at the spot, documents and digital supports, were submitted to the Criminal Prosecution organ and we will examine them\"</em>, explained Zumbreanu.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>We remind you that 15 judges and three judicial executors were arrested yesterday after an extended searches made by the Anti-Corruption Prosecutors and CNA officers. The inspections took place aiming corruption facts.  </p>\r\n<p>Earlier, based on the same fraud case, an ex-governor of BNM (Ema Tabarta), and two Department Chiefs from the National Bank of Moldova. At the same time, a Vice-president of \"Moldincombank\", the chief accountant and deputy chief accountant, also the chief of the bank branch were placed in custody. </p>\r\n<p>We are publishing below the scheme which was the base of the laundering of those over 20 billions: </p>\r\n<p>\n\t\t\t<div class=\"cs_img \"  style=\"width:692px;\">\n\t\t\t <p><a href=\"/images/cms-image-000001409.jpg\" class=\"photoViewer\" title=\"\"> \t\t\t\t<img src=\"/get_img?ImageWidth=692&amp;ImageHeight=396&amp;ImageId=1409\"   border=\"0\"/>\n\t\t\t </a></p> \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\n</p>\r\n<p>\n\t\t\t<div class=\"cs_img \"  style=\"width:694px;\">\n\t\t\t <p><a href=\"/images/cms-image-000001412.jpg\" class=\"photoViewer\" title=\"\"> \t\t\t\t<img src=\"/get_img?ImageWidth=694&amp;ImageHeight=400&amp;ImageId=1412\"   border=\"0\"/>\n\t\t\t </a></p> \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\n</p>\r\n<p>\n\t\t\t<div class=\"cs_img \"  style=\"width:692px;\">\n\t\t\t <p><a href=\"/images/cms-image-000001405.jpg\" class=\"photoViewer\" title=\"\"> \t\t\t\t<img src=\"/get_img?ImageWidth=692&amp;ImageHeight=397&amp;ImageId=1405\"   border=\"0\"/>\n\t\t\t </a></p> \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\n</p>\r\n<p>\n\t\t\t<div class=\"cs_img \"  style=\"width:694px;\">\n\t\t\t <p><a href=\"/images/cms-image-000001408.jpg\" class=\"photoViewer\" title=\"\"> \t\t\t\t<img src=\"/get_img?ImageWidth=694&amp;ImageHeight=390&amp;ImageId=1408\"   border=\"0\"/>\n\t\t\t </a></p> \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\n</p>\r\n<p>\n\t\t\t<div class=\"cs_img \"  style=\"width:701px;\">\n\t\t\t <p><a href=\"/images/cms-image-000001406.jpg\" class=\"photoViewer\" title=\"\"> \t\t\t\t<img src=\"/get_img?ImageWidth=701&amp;ImageHeight=392&amp;ImageId=1406\"   border=\"0\"/>\n\t\t\t </a></p> \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\n</p>\r\n<p>\n\t\t\t<div class=\"cs_img \"  style=\"width:699px;\">\n\t\t\t <p><a href=\"/images/cms-image-000001407.jpg\" class=\"photoViewer\" title=\"\"> \t\t\t\t<img src=\"/get_img?ImageWidth=699&amp;ImageHeight=388&amp;ImageId=1407\"   border=\"0\"/>\n\t\t\t </a></p> \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\n</p>\r\n<p>\n\t\t\t<div class=\"cs_img \"  style=\"width:683px;\">\n\t\t\t <p><a href=\"/images/cms-image-000001411.jpg\" class=\"photoViewer\" title=\"\"> \t\t\t\t<img src=\"/get_img?ImageWidth=683&amp;ImageHeight=387&amp;ImageId=1411\"   border=\"0\"/>\n\t\t\t </a></p> \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\n</p>\r\n<p>\n\t\t\t<div class=\"cs_img \"  style=\"width:692px;\">\n\t\t\t <p><a href=\"/images/cms-image-000001410.jpg\" class=\"photoViewer\" title=\"\"> \t\t\t\t<img src=\"/get_img?ImageWidth=692&amp;ImageHeight=387&amp;ImageId=1410\"   border=\"0\"/>\n\t\t\t </a></p> \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\n</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p> </p>",

The dialog that took place at the request of the Ministry of Defense, was focused on the activity of the Russian Operational maneuver group (GOTR) in the Transnistrian region, as well as other collaboration aspects.    </p>\r\n<p>The Superior of DGPAPA, Colonel Alexandru Harea, expressed during the meeting <strong>the concern of the Ministry of Defense regarding the last actions developed in Transnistria. </strong></p>\r\n<p>The quoted source specified that <strong>the Ministry of Defence condemns the organisation and the development of the so called \"anti-terror\" exercises, as well as the GOTR participation at the organized activities by the so called high administration from Transnistria.</strong>  </p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p><em>\"Actions like this contravene to the international right <em>principle, they are qualified as illegal and they are unacceptable on the territory of the Republic of Moldova, that is why the necessity of the unconditioned retreat of the foreign military formations without a determined judicial status from the territory of the country and their munitions is enforced. <strong>In this context, the administration of the Ministry of Defense requested to inform the Russian Federation Defense Ministry about the unacceptable activities of the GOTR and to take actions for avoiding this kind of activities in the future</strong>\"</em></em><em></em></p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>We remind you that a few days ago, the administration of the Russian Operational Maneuver Group developed other military applications at the Tiraspol's polygon, during which the reject the attack of some presumed \"illegal military formations\" on some military targets from the Tiraspol's garrison. </p>\r\n<p>During the trainings an extra attention was given to mastering the interaction of the GOTR anti-terror sub-units in the open field fights. At the same time, the sapper sub-units developed the research of a mined territory from the parking lot and defused the explosives. During the applications were used over a thousand maneuver rounds and imitation pyrotechnics means.  </p>\r\n<p>We specify the fact that for the first time in history, GOTR realized mutual military applications with so called Transnistrian Military Forces in July and August of 2016. The Ministry of Defense of the Republic of Moldova disapproved those applications and summoned the Military Attache of the Russian Federation to Chisinau, but he refused to come. Chisinau demanded to stop immediately of the applications on its territory.   </p>\r\n<p>GOTR is a part of the Western Military District of the Russian Federation. Vladimir Putin disposed on August 25</p>",

                "Continut": "<p>The new pipeline will connect the existing gas infrastructure networks in Ungheni (Moldova) and Iasi (Romania). The proposed pipeline is approximately 120 km in length and 600 mm diameter.</p>\r\n<p>The EBRD announces on <a href=\"http://www.ebrd.com/cs/Satellite?c=Content&amp;cid=1395252659403&amp;d=Mobile&amp;pagename=EBRD%2FContent%2FContentLayout\" target=\"_blank\">its page</a> that it is working with several partners in the preparation of the project, including with the EU, the Energy Community, the EIB and Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (SIDA) among others.</p>\r\n<p>The project aims to enhance Moldova's energy security by diversifying its gas supply sources. The project will also include a gas sector reform action plan with the objective to liberalize and reform the Moldovan gas sector. Therefore, the project will support the reform agenda in the gas sector through market liberalization in compliance with Moldova's undertakings to EU and  Energy Community.</p>\r\n<p>For the project implementation purposes, the financing will be on-lent by the government of Moldova to VestMoldTransgaz (\"VMTG\"), a fully state-owned transmission system operator of Ungheni-Chisinau gas pipeline and Romania-Moldova interconnector.</p>\r\n<p>The environmental and social appraisal of this project included several site visits (including various meetings and field visits) by EBRD staff. </p>\r\n<p>In the project description on the official page of EBRD, is written that <em>the pipeline crosses areas of relatively low population density, and the land is mainly in private agricultural use, including pastures, orchards and some forest. A large portion of the pipeline parallels an existing utility corridor and is adjacent to an existing road. This approach has been adopted to avoid and minimise environmental and social sensitivities. Further, a robust review of alternative alignments was completed to ensure that the final route was selected to avoid as many impacts as possible. Upon review of the alternatives, alignment 1b was selected. The pipeline will not impact critical habitat nor will it encroach upon any protected area, although it will cross 100 m of the buffer zone for the Plaiul Fagului Scientific Reserve, and will approach the border for the Cazimir Milesti Landscape Reserve (both alignments are allowed according to local legislation and EBRD requirements). It should also be recognised that the pipeline can accommodate micro-realignments of up to 1,000 meters based on any sensitivities or conditions that may be encountered during the construction phase. Any deviations outside this zone will require prior approval by the Bank. </em></p>\r\n<p>In addition to owner monitoring of the implementation of these plans, if the EBRD finances this project, the Bank's Environmental and Sustainability Department will monitor the environmental and social performance during construction and operation of the project.</p>\r\n<p>The Iasi-Ungheni pipeline is interconnecting the gas networks of Romania and Moldova, whose construction began on 27 August 2013. In July 2014, the pipeline was completed, taking place the first tests. It was inaugurated on August 27, 2014, exactly one year after the start of its construction in the presence of the Prime Minister of Moldova, Iurie Leanca and Romanian Prime Minister, Victor Ponta.</p>\r\n<p>The pipeline is expected to transport 500 million cubic meters of gas in the first phase, following in the next phase to be built also a compressor station. The sub-crossing portion of the river is 700 meters, the pipeline is 16 km in length on the Romanian side and 11 km on the Moldovan territory.</p>\r\n<p>The pipeline will be able to carry at full capacity - 1.5 billion cubic meters of gas, more than the 1.3 billion cubic meters of gas which is the necessary consumption of Moldova. The investment is worth €26.5 million.</p>",

According to the activist, the Ministry was sometimes the chairman of the mentioned company.  </p>\r\n<p>Another reason of the protestant was based on the decision to transform the stolen billion in state debt. </p>\r\n<p>In turn, the Minister said that no one asked any money from people, naming Chirtoaca - \"an ass\". Also the official argued with the activist that he does not own \"trailers that can afford Chirtoaca\", showing towards the protestant's trailers. </p>\r\n<p>From the video footage we can see that the hooligan attitude was premeditated. At least this resulted from the fact that the activist Oleg Brega was there, with a video camera to record the moment.   </p>\r\n<p><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/da82UYY6uLk\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></p>",

The protesters stated that they are against the Government decision to transform all the state guarantees for BEM, BS and UB in state debt.",
                "Continut": "<p>The leader of the Socialist Party, Igor Dodon, declared to the protesters at the Parliament that a new Motion of censure against the Filip Government will be lodged. Dodon stated that the lack of quorum is not a reason that they should not examine the Motion of no confidence.   </p>\r\n<p>The protesters have chanted slogans against the Filip Government, in front of the policemen that have surrounded the main entrance of the Parliament.</p>\r\n<p>We specify that at the end of September, the PPDA leader, as well as PAS leader, stated during the <em>\"Interpol\" </em>TV show at the TV7 Chanel that they will go to a mutual protest on the day when the Motion of no confidence will be examined, <em>\"because the money must be recovered from the funds where they have arrived, not from the citizens\"</em>. But today Maia Sandu did not come to the protest. </p>\r\n<p>More than that, the PAS leader, is writing on her Facebook account that <em>\"the initiator of the Motion\"</em> [The president of PSRM, Igor Dodon - Eds.] <em>„is miming the opposition against the government, and the government is miming the application of the democratic tool, which is the Motion of no confidence”. </em></p>\r\n<p>Sandu also writes that <em>\"the meeting was summoned in the way that the mobilization of the citizens would be impossible, the only ones who will carry this burden of this decision. The take over of the debts provoked by the bank theft is a very important subject to be treated with such little seriousness\"</em>. </p>\r\n<p>We remind you that the Motion against the Government failed because of the lack of quorum. At the meeting came 47 deputies from PSRM, PCRM and PLDM. For the first time, the meeting was held by the vice-president Vladimir Vitiuc, but his minute of glory lasted a little longer than a minute.  </p>",

                "Continut": "<p><strong>He made such a statement in the program “Moldova live” on the public TV channel Moldova 1, <a href=\"http://ipn.md/en/economie/79416\" target=\"_blank\">IPN</a> reports.</strong></p>\r\n<p>“We assumed responsibility. This was a precondition imposed by the IMF. Otherwise, we cannot unlock external financing. By unlocking external financing, we spared the people from much bigger problems. Or else we wouldn’t be able to pay salaries, pensions, agricultural subsidies, etc. This would be a too serious blow,” stated the minister.</p>\r\n<p>According to Armasu, the Government assumed this responsibility in order to ensure a return to normality. “We cannot return to normality with the own resources. This month we must sign the agreement with the IMF. Thus, in 2016 we will be able to get €55 million, which is 1 billion lei. Besides this money, there will also be other foreign loans,” said the minister.<br /><br />Octavian Armasu assures that the people will not feel the burden of the repayment of the debt to the National Bank. “We are in an election campaign and they did some electoral calculations, saying the children who are yet to be born will also have to repay this debt. This subject is exploited for electoral purposes. We will make effort for this debt to be repaid with foreign resources more, with grants,” he stated.</p>",

Some of these actions have been realized. I have always wanted the Government not to impose anything by force. Every problem can be solved when all players are participating in the market. I partnered with those from the pharmaceutical domain to identify solutions together. We have reached a common denominator. I'm glad to announce the fruits of this partnership. [...] You cannot get a discount by giving an indication from the Government, because businessmen are businessmen and each business must have profit, but then we have to discuss and see how we can work together,\"</em> added the Prime-Minister.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>We remind you that yesterday the Cabinet of Ministers approved amendments and additions to the Government Decision No. 348 of 2014 which aim to increase people's access to quality and affordable medicines. During this period it has already been established a simplified procedure for registration/re-registration for medicines in the European Economic Area or Switzerland, USA, Canada, Japan, Australia. In these cases, the rates will be 25% smaller than the previous ones. The same thing happens in the case of medical devices. Prices for registration and re-registration of medical devices will be reduced with 25%.</p>",

The Anti-corruption prosecutors conducted searches at his residence and will not communicate if something was found. In these moments, Pantea is in the CNA's insulator.",
                "Continut": "<p>The former Prime Deputy Prosecutor - Andrei Pantea, who executed as well the function of the temporary General Prosecutor of the Republic of Moldova, was arrested by the Anti-corruption prosecutors, are communicating the sources of Deschide.MD.</p>\r\n<p>At the end of June, in a Deschide.MD investigation, we announced about the fact that Andrei Pantea would have helped the investigation committee of the Russian Federation to close the file of the thief in law, Gregory Karamalak, alias \"Bulgaru\". The Criminal prosecution was discontinued in December 2015 - a year and a half away from the transfer of his case to the Moscow, proceedings conducted under the signature of Andrei Pantea.</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p><em>“There were interests. Mr. Pantea being the Prime Deputy Prosecutor, knew very good about the SCJ decision, which was annulling the judge completion of the Rascani, Genadie Morozan, and respectively, had no right to transfer the file to the Russian Federation. From what I know, he did abuse of service and signed the transfer decision when the General Prosecutor Zubco was not in the country. There were rumors that for this transfer were proposed large amounts of money: <strong>between 500 000 and 1.5 million dollars, and if there are rumors of this kind, the truth usually is about in the middle</strong>” declared to us then the former prosecutor of Chisinau, Ivan Diacov in a comment made to Deschide.MD.</em></p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>In turn, Pantea refused to comment on rumors about the amounts which, some say, he would be charged, instead he wanted to explain his decision to transfer the case to the Russian authorities from the legal point of view:</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p><em>\"I will not comment the statements of Mr. Diacov beause I do not want to give any weight to this man, with all due respect that I have towards his career .... All legal procedures were followed, and over the transfer worked an institutional group, therefore, until it came under my signature, the procedure has been prepared by many others. More than that, I returned the file several times because they were not complied with all the requirements for transfer </em><em>\", told us in detail Andrei Pantea.</em></p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>Asked it is true that the transfer was done when Procuorul General was not in the country, Pantea told us: <em>\"It does not matter whether it was or was not. He not initiated this process because the responsibilities were divided.\" </em></p>\r\n<p>A strange fact is that at the end of the discussion, the former Prime Deputy Prosecutor rhetorically asked us on an almost annoyed note: “<em>But who is afraid of this Caramalac. Why do you make him a national hero by paying him so much attention? I think that this is a thing of the past.”</em></p>\r\n<p><em>\n\t\t\t<div class=\"cs_img \"  style=\"width:NaNpx;\">\n\t\t\t <p><a href=\"/images/cms-image-000002573.jpg\" class=\"photoViewer\" title=\"\"> \t\t\t\t<img src=\"/get_img?ImageWidth=1170&amp;ImageHeight=658&amp;ImageId=2573\"   border=\"0\"/>\n\t\t\t </a></p> \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\n</em></p>\r\n<p>Details and documents at this topic you can find in the following article: <a href=\"http://beta.deschide.md/ro/news/investigatii/28983/EXCLUSIV--Ru%C5%9Fii-i-au-clasat-dosarul-lui-Caramalac-P%C3%A2ntea-i-a-ajutat.htm\">EXCLUSIV / Ruşii i-au clasat dosarul lui Caramalac. Pântea i-a ajutat?</a></p>\r\n<p>We mention that Andrei Pantea resigned from his position after the Supreme Council of Prosecutors accepted at September 21, 2015 the request for dismissal. The former prosecutor did not indicate in the application the reason for his leaving.</p>\r\n<p>Gregory Caramalac was charged on the fact that since the mid 90's of last century, the group under his leadership committed a series of murders and robberies, kidnapping, extortion and banditry. In 2008 he obtained Russian citizenship, although in 1998 he was Internationally wanted.</p>\r\n<p>Currently, Caramalac appears in friendly pictures with the leader of \"Our party\", Renato Usatai, and according to unconfirmed reports he would be one who would finance multiple pro-Russian actions in our country.</p>",

Members of the association said they support the approaches and actions of the unionists, aimed at propagating the ideal of the union of the two states, and thus call on the electors to vote for the unionists, no matter who these are.",
                "Continut": "<p>ODIP head Vlad Biletski told a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8bBLqMquV-g\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">news conference</span></a> at IPN that it would be incorrect for society to favor one of the candidates. The voters are those who should judge and analyze the promises and deeds of the electoral competitors.</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p><em>\"I call on the people to take part in the elections as the right to vote is a basic right, being in some of the states an obligation for showing one’s will, because others will decide instead of us if we do not decide,\"</em> stated the young man. </p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>Vlad Biletski noted that ODIP is conducting in Chisinau an opinion poll that covers a sample of 5,000-6,000 people. The goal is to identify the percentage of those who are for the union. It will be thus possible to know the real situation as regards the union, not the informant provided by fixed polls.</p>\r\n<p>The young members of ODIP also aim to stage activities to commemorate the late singers Doina and Ion Aldea Teodorovici.</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p><em>\"For 24 years we have been poorer because we lost two martyrs of the Romanian nation. The association ODIP takes this moment into account and, because presidential elections will be held on October 30, we will hold the commemoration event on October 28, simultaneously in 13 education institutions,\"</em> stated ODIP secretary general Lucia Vieru.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>The songs of the late singers will be played on this day during breaks in a number of lyceums and universities. Moments of silence will be observed also. The students will be informed about the life and work of Doina and Ion Aldea-Teodorovici.</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p><em>\"We consider it is extremely necessary to form and educate the patriotic spirit among students and teachers as well,\"</em> added the young women.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>Also, a 1 km long tricolor will be stretched on Stefan cel Mare Blvd, from the Parliament Building up to the Academy of Sciences of Moldova, on December 1. This year the tricolor will be the longest in the last few years. After the event, several tens of meters of the flag will be donated to universities, schools and kindergartens in Chisinau so that they raise the tricolor on the National Flag Day on April 27, 2017.</p>",

Persons in the antechamber of the president of MIR Company R.I. Batyrshin told us that the institution does not possess information about the dismissal of Ion Terguta,\"</em> reads the statement.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>The signatories call on the Cabinet to review its October 12 decision. According to them, MIR broadcasts round-the-clock on the territory of most of the countries in the CIS, covering millions of TV viewers. That’s why it is very important for the channel to correctly and equidistantly reflect the reality in Moldova.<br /><br />The signatories warn the administration of MIR that the Cabinet’s decision to remove journalist Ion Terguta from the post of director of the Company in Moldova is an act of injustice based not on professionalism-related reasons, but on the rulers’ goal to subdue the press.<br /><br />Among the signatories of the statement are the Independent Journalism Center, the Association of Independent Press, the Electronic Press Association, “Acces-Info” Center, the Journalistic Investigations Center, and the Association of Independent Telejournalists.</p>",

                "lead": "UPDATE (21:19) Shortly after the publication of German Gorbuntsov's interview, the mayor of Balti, Renato Usatii, posted comments on his Facebook page: Again, before the election, Plahotniuc is using Gorbuntsov. We saw this in 2014 when, before withdrawing us from the election, he blamed me of all the bad things. This happens again, Plahotniuc's media-holding is preparing a new movie, where Cristi Tabara and Andrei Cojocaru will fool the whole country. We will see this \"melodrama\" together... Then I will be online and you will understand, however Plahotniuc will be charged according to the law. His fear that I will destroy their system, can be justified.",
                "Continut": "<p>The leader of \"Our Party\", Renato Usatii and Veaceslav Platon, dubbed \"No.1 Raider from CIS\", are just some doers of their masters in Moscow that <em><strong>\"want to buy a country to become honourable citizens\"</strong></em>. This is said by German Gorbuntsov, in an interview with the blogger Veaceslav Balacci. Coincidence or not, but this interview occurred after a group of prosecutors and Ministry of Internal Affairs (MAI) officers conducted a working visit to London, where Gorbuntsov is now.</p>\r\n<p>In the interview of over 30 minutes, German Gorbuntsov, dubbed the \"black banker\" and former shareholder of Moldovan bank Universalbank, says that the <strong><em>\"scheme of  Russian billions laundering is almost identical to that of Renato Usatîi becoming the majority shareholder in Universalbank\"</em></strong> that belonged to Gorbuntsov. The interviewee makes similarities because both schemes were carried out bythe  banks of two members of the criminal group \"Solntsevo\" - Boris Usherovich and Valery Markelov, but also the President of JSC \"Russian Railways\" - Vladimir Yakunin, which would be a close friend of Putin's family. The first two are those who \"actively participated\" in the billions' scheme and even \"<em><strong>invented it. The link between these two schemes is very simple, Renato is working for them [Boris Usherovich and Valery Markelov - Eds.]. He is just a doer. He is doing the work he is paid for, stealing, killing ... everything he can do.\"</strong></em></p>\r\n<p>Regarding the situation in Universalbank, Gorbuntsov said he met with the former Prime Minister, Vlad Filat, who had promised to help him, <strong><em>\"however he did the opposite. Renato Usatii was always waving the ID papers stating that he is Vlad Filat's advisor. After the issue evolved to law court, Usatîi was helped by Platon, who is known in Russia.\"</em></strong> The banker also says in the interview that he has proposed to Usatîi to come to London and pass a lie detector test, and if what Gorbuntsov declares is not confirmed, then he will apologize publicly to Usatîi. However, the leader of \"Our Party\" did not accept the invitation.</p>\r\n<p>Regarding the political career of Usatîi in Moldova, Gorbuntsov said that PN president <em><strong>\"must be at the helm of country\"</strong></em> in order to justify the money he received from <em><strong>\"serious guys\"</strong></em> [...] <em><strong>\"They want to buy a small country to run and hide [Boris Usherovich and Valery Markelov - Eds.], [...] in order to become honourable citizens in a small country.\"</strong></em> Gorbuntsov added that the Moldovan Prosecutor General's Office (PG) is working with Scotland Yard - Metropolitan Police Service and Crown Prosecution Service of Great Britain in its case and that the law authorities of the two countries begin to identify common elements on these lines. However, Gorbuntsov declares that cooperates with law enforcement authorities of both countries.</p>\r\n<p>In this context, Gorbuntsov says that <strong>Usatîi would have tried the other days to pay through an intermediary 600 thousand dollars to the family of Vitalie Proca, who had tried to assassinate Gobuntsov in London, so Proca could give false testimony where the mayor of Balti would not be included.</strong></p>\r\n<p>It should be noted that a group of Moldovan prosecutors from Prosecutor’s Office for the Combating of Organized Crime and Special Causes (Lilian Bacalîm - prosecutor in the organized crime department of PG, Valeriu Bodean - chief of the Organized Crime department and Petrușenco Ruslan - police colonel, chief department, Special causes DOS of IGP), altogether with the officers of the General Inspectorate of Police (IGP) (Gheorghe Cavcaliuc - deputy chief of IGP) of MAI paid a working visit to London. During this visit, Moldovan prosecutors had meetings with the representatives of the Scotland Yard - Metropolitan Police Service, Crown Prosecution Service, and of the National Crime Agency of Great Britain. The trip aimed at strengthening the bilateral relations between the law-enforcers from those two countries, and also <strong>touched on common cases of organized crime relating to both Moldova and Great Britain, in which citizens from both countries were involved.</strong></p>\r\n<p><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/5yrtenrdB28\" width=\"758\" height=\"375\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></p>\r\n<p>The full interview you can view <a href=\"https://balacci.wordpress.com/2016/10/15/exclusiv-dezvaluiri-din-londra-care-arunca-in-aer-agentura-criminala-rusa-din-moldova-interviu-cu-gherman-gorbuntov-video/\">here.</a></p>",

More specifically, it is about Valeriu Malarciuc, who, in exchange of a huge amount of money, had to obtain from Proca a testimony through which the latter denies the fact that Usatai hired him to kill the businessman German Gorbuntsov and also accuses other persons.Meanwhile, the Moldovan prosecutors have not responded yet to our calls to officially confirm the detention of Valeriu Malarciuc.",

The man  The man had intermediated the obtaining of false testimonies from the criminal, Proca in order to save Renato Usatîi from the consequences of acusations against him in the file of assassination attempt of businessman German Gorbuntsov. The action took place in Romania, where Proca is detained, and the one, who did the operation, returned to Moldova to complete the action.</p>\r\n<p>\n\t <div align=\"center\"> \t\t<div class=\"cs_img cs_fl_right\"  style=\"width:216px;\">\n\t\t\t <p><a href=\"/images/cms-image-000002817.jpg\" class=\"photoViewer\" title=\"\"> \t\t\t\t<img src=\"/get_img?ImageRatio=40&amp;ImageWidth=216&amp;ImageHeight=384&amp;ImageId=2817\"   border=\"0\"/>\n\t\t\t </a></p> \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t</div>\n</p>\r\n<p>Our sources from the investigation say that Valeriu Malarciuc has admitted his guilt. Moreover, the investigators have interceptions of Proca's conversations, who is detained in a prison in Romania, on which he plotted the details and the amount of money he would receive for these testimonies. Prosecutors also have identified other persons that Renato Usatîi used to plan this setup.</p>\r\n<p>We remind that about the \"mission\" of Malarciuc, also spoke Gorbuntsov in the recent <a href=\"http://www.deschide.md/en/news/social_en/1882/Gorbuntsov's-revelations-about-Usatii-and-Platon-and-the-true-masters-who-want-to-%E2%80%9Ebuy-a-country%E2%80%9D.htm\" target=\"_blank\">interview</a> for the blogger Veaceslav Balacci. In the interview, the businessman who is a refugee in London, sent a message to Renato Usatîi saying that this operation will not succeed, because he knows the name of the intermediary and the amount of money that would be paid. It seems that also Gorbuntsov is the one who alerted the authorities of several states interested in the case, about this operation.</p>\r\n<p>We note that previous days on the Prosecutor General's Office site and the IPG one was published a press release about a visit of several investigators in London (Lilian Bacalîm - prosecutor in the organized crime department of PG, Valeriu Bodean - chief of the Organized Crime department and Petrușenco Ruslan - police colonel, chief department, Special causes DOS of IGP and Gheorghe Cavcaliuc - deputy chief of IGP).</p>\r\n<p>Apparently, it seems to have been an official working visit, but our sources say that actually the Moldovan investigators attended the hearing of Gorbuntsov and exchanged information with British investigators on the case. Moreover, the information is confirmed by a <a href=\"https://balacci.wordpress.com/2016/10/16/exclusiv-gherman-gorbuntov-audiat-la-londra-de-procurori-foto/poza-2/\" target=\"_blank\">photo</a> published today by the blogger, Balacci.</p>\r\n<p>\n\t\t\t<div class=\"cs_img \"  style=\"width:630px;\">\n\t\t\t <p><a href=\"/images/cms-image-000002815.jpg\" class=\"photoViewer\" title=\"\"> \t\t\t\t<img src=\"/get_img?ImageWidth=630&amp;ImageHeight=354&amp;ImageId=2815\"   border=\"0\"/>\n\t\t\t </a></p> \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\n</p>\r\n<p>The reason that Proca's false testimony staging was attempted seems to be based on the investigation's progression and respectively - the attempt of Renato Usatii to save himself. Moreover, for more than a month \"Our Party\" leader left the country and did not return yet.</p>\r\n<p>We remind you that in spring of 2012, German Gorbuntsov was shot 7 times as he entered his flat in London. It was later determined that the culprit was Vitalie Proca - a killer, later convicted for another crime committed at command in Bucharest. Later, Gorbuntsov offered a first interview on this subject in which he said that his death was ordered by Renato Usatîi - who does what the other two businessmen from Russia tell him, former friends and business colleagues of Gorbuntsov. The last two, in turn, are under the protection of Russian Railways chief - a man close to Vladimir Putin.</p>\r\n<p>After the revelations and accusations of Gorbunţov, Usatîi wrote a denunciation to the Moldovan Prosecutor General's Office by saying that in fact he had been the target of an assassination. Based on his denunciation was started a criminal dossier, and previous days, the deputy chief of the Prosecutor’s Office for the Combating of Organized Crime and Special Causes, Corneliu Bratunov, <a href=\"http://www.deschide.md/ro/stiri/social/1471/Procurorii-despre-dosarele-lui-Usat%C3%AEi-Exist%C4%83-unul-singur-Cel-ini%C5%A3iat-chiar-de--Usat%C3%AEi.htm\" target=\"_blank\">declared that</a> <em>\"the only file in the investigation where appears Renato Usatîi is the one initiated by him, on other people initiated a long time ago where several stages of the investigation passed and the new elements are some details that incriminate inclusively the author of the testimony.\"</em></p>\r\n<p>It should be also noted that, yesterday, Shortly after the publication of German Gorbuntsov's interview, the mayor of Balti, Renato Usatii, posted comments on his Facebook page: <em><strong>Again, before the election, Plahotniuc is using Gorbuntsov. We saw this in 2014 when, before withdrawing us from the election, he blamed me of all the bad things. This happens again, Plahotniuc's media-holding is preparing a new movie, where Cristi Tabara and Andrei Cojocaru will fool the whole country. We will see this \"melodrama\" together... Then I will be online and you will understand, however Plahotniuc will be charged according to the law. His fear that I will destroy their system, can be justified.</strong></em></p>\r\n<p>Meanwhile, the Moldovan prosecutors have not responded yet to our calls to officially confirm the detention of Valeriu Malarciuc.</p>\r\n<p>We will come back with details...</p>",

                "lead": "The patent holders will take to the streets on October 20. The protest will be first mounted in front of the Government Building. Afterward, the protesters will go on a march to the Parliament Building, president of the Small Business Association Eugen Roscovanu stated in a news conference at IPN. He said the situation of patent holders becomes increasingly difficult owing to bureaucracy and they thus decided to protest.",
                "Continut": "<blockquote>\r\n<p><em>\"The economy is stagnant, while the national bureaucrats compete against each other in creating barriers to businesspeople and new constraints. They permanently invent strange bills and Government decisions in a move to make the existence of small businesses more difficult. Thus, the number of small enterprises decreases, revenues from sales decline and the number of new jobs created at small and medium-sized enterprises diminishes. The foreign and home trade indexes decrease, while the government produces triumphalist reports,\"</em> stated Eugen Roscovanu.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>He added that the economic crisis in the country deepens, while the regulations that should promote the development of small businesses do not stimulate this sector. This fact made the business people to take to the streets.<br /><br />Director of the Small Business Association’s branch in northern Moldova Grigore Marciuc said the working group that was to be constituted by the government to discuss the problems of patent holders, with the involvement of representatives of small businesses, has done nothing yet. The small traders were invited to no meeting of this group. The patent holders from the northern districts are ready to protest as soon as possible because it is impossible to work in the conditions proposed by the authorities.<br /><br />Local councilor in Stefan Voda, Olga Cheapki, patent holder, said the government, which she called deaf and mute, does nothing but pretend to be doing reforms. The patent holders agreed to have their way of activity modified from 2017, but asked for an alternative, but the alternative proposed by the government, which is shifting from patent to enterprise, does not ensure a job and social grantees.</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p><em>\"As you did nothing to create new jobs, you should not remove the patent. Do not touch it. We ask to be listened to and heard. I call on all the patent holders to combine forces and take to the streets to demand rights,\"</em> she stated.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>Eleonora Turcanu-Herghelegiu, director of the southern branch of the Small Business Association, said there are entrepreneurs who earn more than 300,000 lei a month, but these represent 5-10% in district centers, unlike Chisinau and Balti, where this figure is much higher. The woman called on the authorities to take into account these differences when formulating policies in the field.</p>\r\n<p>Local adviser in Rezina Alexandru Veshnieski, patent holder, said that 20% of the SMEs went bankrupt during the past year and the state of affairs in the national economy is far from being good.</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p><em>\"We do not want to be the exchange card in someone’s games. We do not want to do politics. We ask one thing from the government – to find a method of solving the problem of those who work based on patent,\"</em> he stated.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>The patent holders concluded that if the situation does not improve, a large part of the national entrepreneurs will move to the underground economy or will emigrate.</p>\r\n<p>Source: <a href=\"http://ipn.md/ro/societate/79655\" target=\"_blank\">IPN</a></p>",

As if to say, they went to take depositions from the one who is internationally wanted,\"</em></strong> Usatîi said, mentioning that on the name of banker Gorbuntsov are opened several criminal cases. </p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>We specify, however, that the former president of Universalbank, <strong>German Gorbuntsov, has turned himself in on March 21, 2014 at the Metropolitan Police Service Extradition Unit (Scotland Yard). Afterwards, he was arrested, based on three warrants.</strong> After his collaboration with Scotland Yard's investigation he was removed from the list of persons under international search, in which he was in 2012. About his collaboration with investigators tells Gorbuntsov himself in an interview with the blogger Veaceslav Balacci.</p>\r\n<p>At the same time we remind you that Gorbuntsov omitted to say in the same interview, that he was suspected <strong>for several crimes between 2010 - 2011, i.e. blackmail, attempted of obstruction of justice, theft and attempted of murder. The banker says that when he left Moldova no criminal case was not opened on his name.</strong></p>\r\n<div>Until he fled in 2010 from Russia to Moldova, Gorbuntsov held at least eight banks in the Russian Federation, many of them being involved in money laundering and tax evasion.</div>",

                "lead": "The prosecutors announced that they detained two people who tried to \"buy\" from killer Vitalie Proca, false testimonies in the case on assassination attempt of banker German Gorbuntsov. Prosecutors declined to give the name of the one who ordered the false testimonies, but in the public space is known that is Renato Usatîi. Investigators say the two people detained, cooperate with the investigation and have already admitted guilt.",
                "Continut": "<p>One of those detained went to Bucharest, where is detained Vitalie Proca, met with killer and gave him a tape recorder for the latter to record his false testimony. Later the \"messenger\" returned to Moldova, from where he went to Moscow to meet with the final beneficiary (Renato Usatîi - Eds.).</p>\r\n<p>The testimony was supposed to be purchased from Proca in exchange of a sum of 600 thousand dollars. A first tranche of 100 thousand was granted to one of the two detained who has bought more goods including a car, and the second part of the money was given to Proca's wife. The latter has also bought a luxury car.</p>\r\n<p>Prosecutors say they have all the documents confirming this and more phone records that lead to the final beneficiary.</p>\r\n<p>The police say that the final beneficiary (Renato Usatîi - Eds.) will certainly have a procedural status in this file. This, however, is going to be determined later by those managing the investigation.</p>\r\n<p>We remind you that in spring of 2012, German Gorbuntsov was shot 7 times as he entered his flat in London. It was later determined that the culprit was Vitalie Proca - a killer, later convicted for another crime committed at command in Bucharest. Later, Gorbuntsov offered a first interview on this subject in which he said that his death was ordered by Renato Usatîi - who does what the other two businessmen from Russia tell him, former friends and business colleagues of Gorbuntsov. The last two, in turn, are under the protection of Russian Railways chief - a man close to Vladimir Putin.</p>\r\n<p>After the revelations and accusations of Gorbunţov, Usatîi wrote a denunciation to the Moldovan Prosecutor General's Office by saying that in fact he had been the target of an assassination. Based on his denunciation was started a criminal dossier, and previous days, the deputy chief of the Prosecutor’s Office for the Combating of Organized Crime and Special Causes, Corneliu Bratunov, <a href=\"http://www.deschide.md/ro/stiri/social/1471/Procurorii-despre-dosarele-lui-Usat%C3%AEi-Exist%C4%83-unul-singur-Cel-ini%C5%A3iat-chiar-de--Usat%C3%AEi.htm\" target=\"_blank\">declared that</a> <em>\"the only file in the investigation where appears Renato Usatîi is the one initiated by him, on other people initiated a long time ago where several stages of the investigation passed and the new elements are some details that incriminate inclusively the author of the testimony.\"</em></p>\r\n<p>As well we remind that <a href=\"/en/news/social_en/1894/EXCLUSIVE--Usatii's-Intermediary-is-detained!-He-tried-to-%E2%80%9Ebuy%E2%80%9D-testimonies-from-the-killer-Proca.htm\" target=\"_blank\">Deschide.MD</a> wrote two days ago about the detention of one of the persons that the prosecutors referred to. It is about Valeriu Malarciuc, who, in exchange of a huge amount of money, had to obtain from Proca a testimony through which the latter denies the fact that Usatai hired him to kill the businessman German Gorbuntsov and also accuses other persons. About the \"mission\" of Malarciuc, also Gorbuntsov said in the <a href=\"http://www.deschide.md/en/news/social_en/1882/Gorbuntsov's-revelations-about-Usatii-and-Platon-and-the-true-masters-who-want-to-%E2%80%9Ebuy-a-country%E2%80%9D.htm\" target=\"_blank\">interview</a> given the previous days to the blogger Veaceslav Balacci.</p>",

After he promoted the necessary regulation of casinos' activity and a few days ago police shut them all down, the politician is after drug dealers. In a message posted on his blog, Plahotniuc warns those dealing with such activities that the countdown has begun.",

To understand what a criminal group was acting behind this activity is sufficient to notice how they attempted to fraud the licensing system after the intervention of the authorities in this area was publicly announced. They hoped to gain fraudulently one more year in this way and oppose the measures taken by institutions</em><em>\"</em>, Plahotniuc wrote.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>According to him,<em> \"that persons not only have to pay the damages to the state, but must answer before the law and for the way they tried to prolong criminal activity. As well, the officials who helped him must go behind bars.\"</em></p>\r\n<p>Further, Vlad Plahotniuc says that another serious problem is related to the drug consumption. This topic is on the agenda and with his colleagues in the ruling coalition and institutions, they will do everything possible to stop this phenomenon, and those who have participated in developing them will answer before the law.</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p><em> \"Unfortunately, this phenomenon is more noticeable also among children. The adult giving narcotics to children actually destroy lives, therefore they are criminals and must be treated duly. My message to all those involved in this criminal activity is clear: the countdown has begun, it's just a matter of time before they are caught. Short time. This topic is on my agenda and together with colleagues from the ruling coalition and institutions, we will do everything possible to stop this phenomenon, and those who have participated in developing it will answer before the law.</em></p>\r\n<p><em><em>My message to all those involved in this criminal activity is clear: the countdown has begun, it's just a matter of time before they are caught. Short time.</em>\"</em>, Plahotniuc concluded.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>We remind that about 1,000 police officers have received this weekend the mission to shut down and seal all casinos in the country after on Saturday the Licensing Chamber announced that it has suspended 65 licenses of activity for gambling, stakes, casinos and game machines. Police officers were about to close 320 casinos that currently have a valid license of activity.</p>\r\n<p>The suspension of 65 licenses is due to multiple violations identified in the review carried out by the Financial Inspection under the Ministry of Finance and investigations conducted by the Anti-corruption Prosecutor's Office together with the National Anti-Corruption Center.</p>\r\n<p>Among the infringements found was the defrauding of the \"e-licensing\" system which led to a large-scale damage of state budget.</p>\r\n<p>We remind that five employees of the State Licensing Chamber were arrested on Saturday after an operation conducted by anti-corruption prosecutors and CNA officers.</p>\r\n<p>The public servants, including the Deputy Director of the institution, are suspected of having committed a series of frauds on the issue or extension of licenses for operators, providing services in the field of gambling, which caused damage of 15 million lei to the state budget.</p>",

This covered the period between October 10 and 19. Thus, seven TV channels were fined the highest amount 5,400 lei, a TV channel was warned publicly, while three broadcasters were only warned, IPN reports.",
                "Continut": "<p>The report shows the TV channels with national coverage - <em><strong>Prime TV, Canal 3, Canal 2</strong></em> and <strong><em>Publika TV</em></strong> - continued to massively favor the Democratic Party’s candidate Marian Lupu and to disfavor the candidate of the PPPDA Andrei Nastase. Jurnal TV favored massively the PPPDA’s candidate and disfavored the PDM’s candidate. It should be noted that the monitoring covered the period before Nastase and Lupu withdrew from the presidential race.</p>\r\n<p>During October 10-19, Accent TV and NTV Moldova presented the Socialist candidate Igor Dodon mainly in a favorable light compared with the other election runners.</p>\r\n<p>All these broadcasters were fined the highest amount.</p>\r\n<p>N4 was warned publicly for covering insufficiently the election campaign. <strong><em>Realitatea TV, Pro TV</em></strong> and <strong><em>Ren Moldova</em></strong> were warned over the slight imbalance in covering the election campaign. The public TV channel Moldova 1 covered the electoral activities of the candidates for President rather impartially.</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p><em>\"The situation is worse compared with the first report both in terms of the imbalance in the volume of airtime and of the connotation of the materials. Even the broadcasters that we gave as an example as regards the covering of the election campaign now didn’t ensure a proper balance,\"</em> said the Councils chairman Dinu Ciocan.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>Council member Olga Gututui said the broadcasters were obliged to offer airtime to all the candidates, but only Moldova 1 did this.</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p><em>\"I will request the broadcasters to provide information about whom and when they allotted airtime,\"</em> she stated.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>Member Mariana Onceanu-Hadarca said the report shows the citizens of Moldova are used as voting machines. She stated that Prime TV, Canal 3, Canal 2 and Publika TV continue to defy all the broadcasting norms, noting a democratic society is not possible with antidemocratic covering.<br /><br />The Council members expressed their regret at the fact that the broadcasting legislation wasn’t amended so that the punishment matched now the gravity of the committed violations.</p>",

Prosecutors documented amounts ranging from 20 euros to 650 euros.</p>\r\n<p>Bogdan Zumbreanu said that some of the detainees have pleaded guilty and cooperate with the investigation.</p>\r\n<p>Customs and border police employees of the border police are accused of taking bribes for international routes in exchange of not charging drivers that circulated in basis of inter-bus cards. Meanwhile, licenses from Auto Transport National Agency costs 9000 euros per route and if a businessman has several routes - 5000 euros. Normally, these drivers were to be charged with 1,200 lei each, and the businessman - with 9,000 lei. </p>\r\n<p>Following today's operation were arrested 14 customs officers, 3 border police officers, 5 businessmen and 7 drivers. The operation was conducted with the support of the internal security department of Customs Service and Border Police.</p>",

They also suggested that all those interested – journalists, representatives of civil society and others – should submit proposals on the issue. The SCM members didn’t set deadlines in this regard,\"</em> said the press service.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>At the end of October, NGOs and editorial staffs of media outlets protested against the imposition by these regulations of abusive restrictions contrary to the European practices in the area of access to information and media access to courts of law. These described the adoption by the SCM of the regulations concerning access to courts of law as abuse by the Council by which additional restrictions on the access to hearings are imposed on journalists and editorial staffs of media outlets. They requested the SCM to annul its decision to approve the regulations and to initiate discussions on the issue with the participation of journalists and media outlets.<br /><br />The regulations provide, among others, that an application for participation should be filed 24 hours before the hearing, by presenting the identity card and a copy of it and by having special accreditation for access to court of law.</p>",

I defended a number of persons who are inconvenient to Vlad Plahotniuc and stated my personal opinion. I became inconvenient thus. I have evidence that Plahotniuc is the one who decides when the cases started by his order should be continued or dropped,\"</em> she stated.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>Ana Ursachi presented a statement that she said was signed by Veaceslav Platon at the end of 2014 and was authenticated by a notary. In this, Platon admits that he made false depositions for Dutch lawyers in order to help Plahotniuc get rid of the distrain imposed on his property worth €46m by a Dutch court.<br /><br />Ana Ursachi is the lawyer of Veaceslav Platon, Grigore Petrenco and leaders of the Party \"Platform Dignity and Truth\". The Prosecutor General’s Office reopened a case started against Ana Ursachi in 1998 over the murder of a teacher for appropriating her apartment. Ursachi was acquitted, while her ex-husband Ruslan Moiseev and his accomplice got jail terms.</p>",

The Central Office did not believe the story of Plahotniuc about ordering the murder of Gorbuntsov ... I found lawyers in the US, EU and Russia that had to demonstrate that I am pursued for political reasons. It did not come to this, because Lyon took me out of the search,\"</em> he said.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>We recall that a similar situation occurred in the spring of 2015. Then, after nearly two months while police searched unsuccessfully for the former Minister of Internal Affairs Gheorghe Papuc, who was sentenced to four years in prison in April 7th case. The representatives of the Ministry of Internal Affairs sent a request to Interpol to be searched abroad. In turn, the international organization refused the request of Moldovan policemen, arguing that it would be about a politically charged case.</p>",

                "lead": "The so-called judicial system of the Transnistrian region does not ensure the observance of human rights and the Moldovan constitutional authorities should institute monitoring mechanisms, with the involvement of civil society. It is also important to ensure the human rights defender’ access to the left side of the Nistru. Such recommendations were made in an UN session that centered on the Universal Periodic Review last week.",
                "Continut": "<p>In a <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i833ZoMXbC0\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">news conference</span></a> at IPN, “Promo-LEX” jurist Nicoleta Hriplivyi said that in the session a number of states laid emphasis on the existence of systemic problems in the Transnistrian region, while Georgia proposed instituting an efficient mechanism, with the participation of civil society, for monitoring the observance of human rights by the separatist administration.<br /><br />The jurist noted that the Moldovan delegation pleaded for including the subject of observance of human rights in the 5+2 Transnistrian conflict settlement talks that have focused so far on economic and social problems.<br /><br />“Promo-LEX” head Ion Manole said that if a victim of the illegalities of the so-called investigation bodies of Transnistria does not have relatives that can defend his interests, this has practically no chance of obtaining justice. In the Transnistrian region, there is no civil society and independent press. In this connection, the Moldovan constitutional authorities and the international organizations are requested to ensure the human rights defender’s access to the region.<br /><br />“The fact that the Transnistrian administration bans the access of defenders of human rights to the region is a signal that something is being hidden. The persecution and abuses on the part of the investigation bodies continue there,” stated Ion Manole.<br /><br />The jurists of “Promo-LEX” haven’t had access to the Transnistrian region for over a year and a half. Ion Manole said a society without defenders of human rights is unstable and cannot develop.<br /><br />“Promo-LEX” manages about 70 cases concerning human rights violations in Transnistria. In about 20 cases of these, the ECHR is to pass judgment. In four cases, the High Court already convicted Moldova and Russia of human rights violations.</p>\r\n<p><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/i833ZoMXbC0?rel=0\" width=\"640\" height=\"360\" frameborder=\"0\" style=\"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></p>\r\n<p>Source: <a href=\"http://ipn.md/en/societate/80140\" target=\"_blank\">IPN</a></p>",

Cavcaliuc personally keeps this under control and the Special Operations Department (DOS) examines the case.

                "lead": "Representatives of the main justice sector institutions and civil society of Moldova and Romania came together in Chisinau to exchange good practices in justice and the fight against corruption. Speaker of Parliament Adrian Candu voiced hope that the discussion platform will become a tradition and a format for debating ideas and proposals that Moldova can borrow from Romania’s experience in reforming the justice sector, IPN reports.",
                "Continut": "<p>Adrian Candu said that since 2009, the judicial system reform has been a priority for Moldova. Owing to particular delays, the credibility of the law enforcement agencies diminished. \"And this is reasonable as we, the politicians, didn’t manage to show sufficient political will so as to go till the end. The situation in the Republic of Moldova, the political and economic crisis we experienced shows that we no longer have excuses and time. What we tried and managed to do this year was to mobilize and lay the foundations of an independent, efficient and correct justice,\" he stated.<br /><br />Minister of Justice of Moldova Vladimir Cebotari said the state institutions during the past year showed unprecedented political determination in the reformation process. \"The delays in working out reform strategies were the main indicator and the main argument that led to a deterioration in the diplomatic relations between the Republic of Moldova and the development partners. Today, the progress we made in reforming the justice sector, alongside the financial market reforms, is the first sign showing that the Republic of Moldova returns to discussions with the development partners,\" he stated.<br /><br />Minister of Justice of Romania Raluca Alexandra Pruna said the forum organized at such a high level shows an impressive solidarity exercise to which the two sides responded. \"For Romania, the relationship with the Republic of Moldova is a durable theme on the public agenda. A consensus was reached, as you know, at the level of the Romanian political class, but the consensus existing at the level of Romanian society is even more important. The bilateral cooperation in justice has strategic values and represents an essential component for implementing the strategic partnership between the Republic of Moldova and Romania,\" said the official.<br /><br />Raluca Alexandra Pruna added that Romanian went through the reformation and modernization of the state institutions in the European integration process and will share its experience because the modernization of state institutions is impossible without really independent justice.<br /><br />Romania’s Ambassador in Chisinau Daniel Ionita said the intergovernmental cooperation themes entered the DNA of the Romanian-Moldovan relations. This year Moldova showed the first positive signals in the field through the adoption of the package of laws on the reformation of the prosecution service. The first cases of corruption fighting in state institutions were reported. The country agreement of the IMF with Moldova, approved on November 7, shows that the initiated reforms were appreciated not only in Bucharest, but also at international level.</p>",

The statement was made during the first Moldovan-Romanian Forum of justice, following a question from the audience in the hall. However, in the hall are the heads of all institutions of the Romanian judicial system and their Moldovan counterparts.",
                "Continut": "<p>Harunjen said from the start that the question exceeds him because the management strategy of this case was decided by a certain prosecutor which has independence of action. He also recognized that in terms of institutional PR, the General Prosecutor's Office would gain much more if this process would have been public.</p>\r\n<p><em>\"I would like to think that the society wants a result from justice and is less interested in the show. I do not know if it is our luck or misfortune, but in a very short period we have been able to investigate two former prime ministers being prosecuted for various infringements. Many of the actions that we undertook have generated some unprecedented attacks on our institution,\"</em> said Harunjen.</p>\r\n<p>Acting Prosecutor General mentioned that Vlad Filat was controlling several media institutions in the moment of his detention through which he put pressure on the criminal prosecution body.</p>\r\n<p><em>\"I think it is no secret that the investigated subject has a lot of media trusts through which he tried to exert pressure. As it is no secret for jurists that a dossier on such a scale in which huge amounts are being investigated, respectively - is compressed a huge political force, no doubt there is pressure on the participants of the process,\"</em> he said.</p>\r\n<p><em>Harunjen assured that the dossier of the former prime-minister will be made public when will be completed the incorporation and legalization of evidence process and where it will not go on what means evidentiary material.</em></p>\r\n<p><em>\"You do realize well that the conviction cannot be kept secret forever, it will be published, but we have two courts examining the meritsof cause. I would not want to justify myself, but it is unreally hard to manage such cases, to give assurances to the trial participants that they will not be put under pressure from different social groups,\"</em> said the acting head of state accusers.</p>\r\n<p>Harunjen concluded that the examination of the secret dossier of Filat was done according to the legal provision which says that in special cases, the file can be examined in a closed session.</p>",

The lowest turnout was in Cantemir district – about 41% of the voters.<br /><br />The profile of voters shows that the 26-40 age category was the most active one. The turnout in this category was over 27%. The number of women who voted in elections was by almost 100,000 higher than that of men.<br /><br />CEC president Alina Russu said two more electoral reports were processed by this hour – from a polling place in Sacramento, U.S., and from a polling place in Montroy, France. Only two of the reports came to the CEC in paper form – from the districts of Soldanesti and Dubasari.<br /><br />CEC member Iurie Ciocan said the two parcels with lost ballots reached the destination. They were sent back to Chisinau without being opened.</p>",

Her carbonized remains were found the building four days later, <a href=\"http://ipn.md/ro/societate/80350\" target=\"_blank\">IPN</a> reports.</p>\r\n<p>The platform guvern24.md made a public appeal to donate money so as to raise €1,000 for the woman’s burial.<br /><br />In the case of the killed fireman, the platform made a similar appeal for collecting about 300,000 lei, which is the family’s debt to a bank.

According to him, \"Vitas\" was detained this morning by IGP officers in Vadul lui Voda, while the convict was in a car. \"More details will be provided to the media via a communique or a press briefing,\" concluded Gheorghe Cavcaliuc.",
                "Continut": "<p>The IGP investigation officers detained Vitalie Burlacu, \"aka\" - The Karate man - the main figurehead in the dossier on corruption of MP's. The information was confirmed for Deschide.MD portal by reliable sources within the institution. Burlacu is one of the close men of the businessman Veacelsav Plato, as confirmed by businessman himself - nicknamed \"The No.1 Raider\" in the CIS.</p>\r\n<p>The main accused in the corruption case of MPs, Vitalie Burlacu, was wanted in April, currently being issued an arrest warrant of 30 days on his name. A few months later, the court sentenced him to 11 years and 4 months of imprisonment, the sentence being delivered in his absence.</p>\r\n<p>His friend, who figures in the same case - Irina Baglai - was sentenced to three years of imprisonment with suspension for a period of two years.</p>\r\n<p>Vitalie Burlacu still has to pay a fine of 160 thousand MDL. However, the prosecutors demanded the confiscation of the money found during prosecution. It is about approximately 550 thousand euros and about 400,000 dollars.</p>\r\n<p>In the MPs corruption file, initiated in 2014, are targeted the former police officer Vitalie Burlacu and the model Irina Baglai. Firstly, the two have been arrested after they were investigated at large. They are suspected of trying to offer to an MP 250 thousand dollars to convince him to leave the fraction to which he belongs.</p>",
