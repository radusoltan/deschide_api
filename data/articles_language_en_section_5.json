                "lead": "Slowly but firmly, we enter the presidential election fever. Some parties already chosen the candidate, others have to do it in the near future. We also have an independent one: the parliamentarian Valeriu Ghilețchii made public his intention to run on its own for the president of the country.",
                "Continut": "<p>Slowly but firmly, we enter the presidential election fever. Some parties already chosen the candidate, others have to do it in the near future. We also have an independent one: the parliamentarian Valeriu Ghilețchii made public his intention to run on its own for the president of the country.</p>\r\n<p>Following surveys, trends and the balance of forces in the political arena, we see how the main favorites for the presidential elections in October are created. After all the probabilities, they will be three: the leader of the socialists, candidate of the “right-wing” (this positioning right-center-left is relative when we talk about the political spectrum in our country) and the PD representative.</p>\r\n<p>The main subjects of the campaign, probably, are going to be two.</p>\r\n<p>The first one, fight against corruption. Debates will be held on the question: “Where is the milliard?”. In the remaining time until the elections, unlikely to have a clear answer, so it is possible that we will witness how the thief will scream louder than the others: “Catch the thief!”.</p>\r\n<p>The second subject of the campaign will be further fueled by the traditional geopolitical cleavage. Now this will be marked by the union subject, which finds more and more supporters in the society.</p>\r\n<p>Socialist candidate, Igor Dodon, is credited now with the best chance of winning. Should be noted that the leader of PSRM doesn’t want so much to be a president, he wants more than that, which he declared publicly. Socialists tried their best to postpone the election of the president. Let us recall that the deputies of the PSRM faction voted against establishing the date of elections, and then there were those who disputed it at the Venice Commission. In the case the president would be elected, over Igor Dodon – and the entire party – will overshadow the danger to be identified with the government, and this might be unfavorable for the next parliamentary elections.  Therefore he will do his best to be noticed, with or without a work, with or without reason, and declaring their separate position thus causing conflicts with the parliamentary majority or with those from the Government. Socialist leader did not even hesitate to declare openly that he is coming more to fight than to work with other state institutions. Meanwhile, the early elections would also not benefit socialists. Renato Usatîi can recover some of the voters who gave their vote to PSRM at the last elections, when Our Party was removed from the race in the last minutes. Therefore, PSRM goes to the protests announced by Usatîi, more out of inertia and visibility, and Igor Dodon wants presidency so anyone else could not get it. In the event that Igor Dodon is elected president, the implementation of the Association Agreement with the EU will go on more difficult and the process of modernization of Moldovan society will only suffer.</p>\r\n<p>Through a joint communique, the Party of Action and Solidarity, Truth and Justice Party and the Liberal Democratic Party of Moldova informs us that in the presidential election they form a unity and that they intend to come up with a common candidate. Following, probably, the strict mathematical calculation, according to which the joint candidate has only to sum up the three parties’ votes, if they went separately, the three want to dance a hora: “There is strength in numbers!”. The logic of political competition, especially the struggle for power doesn’t always coincide with formal logic. We will live and we will see. Until then, though, they will have to face a very difficult test: to identify the candidate. It's hard to imagine that those who are behind Andrei Năstase will agree to support anyone besides their own candidate. Therefore, it is difficult to believe that, if not all, but the most PAS supporters (many of which are intellectuals, after the revelations in the press) but also the inappropriate behavior of the PDA leader will agree to give him the vote. These, in the absence of any viable alternatives probably will not go to vote and would prefer to stay at home. I will not say anything about PLDM. The people there get upset, when you give the opinion about them and their often foolish actions. They do not like when you come with suggestions or if, God forbid, dare to criticize. After that, they call you and tell who pays you. Therefore, only good about PLDM or nothing at all.</p>\r\n<p>A word to say on the right (this time the real one), would have Iurie Leancă, PPEM candidate. From the position of a constructive opposition, which was placed in the popular Europeans’ leader, with the support of European partners, Iurie Leancă’s candidacy might be one of the best for the Presidency. Nevertheless, now, the former prime minister has a problem: to denigrate his image were working and are still working hard. Excelled here equally the former party colleagues, Platform supporters and opponents on the left. As far as the PPEM leader will be able to build a persuasive campaign, based on a critical speech, but constructive one at the same time, has a chance to recover the previous rating.</p>\r\n<p>Of those who count on the presidential election - PD, PCRM, PL and PN – have not announced their candidate yet. A mystery remains whom will the democrats propose. The public space is circulated by several names and scenarios. One thing is clear: for Democrats’ candidate accession in the second round will be a very difficult task. At first glance, it does not seem so complicated for a centrist party that could take votes from both right and left. However, assuming the government, additionally to the advantage of available administrative resources, also brings burden of responsibility for all the failures from the last years. Even if the economic and financial slippage was stopped, it is still early to speak about a tangible improvement to benefit the citizens, so as to influence their decision to vote. Henceforward the very heavy mission for the democratic candidate is to get in the second round and then to win the election.</p>\r\n<p>For the Liberal Party - also part of the ruling coalition - is precisely the right moment to try to claim back the unionist electorate, which, as mentioned, is growing. A lot depends on the candidate who would run in elections. If the PL leader insists on himself, the allegations about political death of both the Liberal leader and the party will not seem an exaggeration anymore.</p>\r\n<p>PCRM and its leader, Vladimir Voronin, the favorite of the surveys and analyzes conducted a few years ago, obviously lost the positions he once had. On the other hand, at the last parliamentary election from November 30, 2014, PCRM has achieved a relatively good score – over 17 percent of the suffrages, the chances of the communist candidate to reach the second round are rather hypothetical.</p>\r\n<p>We have to see how will act those from Our Party. Renato Usatîi cannot, because he is younger, and a someone with similar opportunities, the party does not have. Only if someone outside the party is put forward. He will have no chance, however he can take some of the votes from Igor Dodon, in the geopolitical dimension and some of Andrei Nastase’s votes, in the populist one. Consequently, probably, PN will not submit anyone, leaving some voters to go to the platform leader, thus giving him an advantage in the competition with Maia Sandu for a single candidate from those three parties.</p>\r\n<p>The roads and intentions of the presidential candidates are tangled and unknown! The privileges offered by the Constitution to the president of the Republic of Moldova and the role played by him in the political system are not as important as the battle and the sufferings that are provoked by the electoral fight. It is not worth the effort. I remain convinced that the election of the President by the whole nation is a luxury that we cannot afford. An elected president that would be in opposition with the majority of the government will be a permanent destabilizing factor. The Constitutional Court repaired a procedural mistake committed in the past, but Parliament, in turn, could go back on its decisions and develop such a mechanism for electing the President, simple and effective, which would avoid all sorts of slippages and political crises. This requires courage and political wisdom, while we continue to wade in cheap populism and ignorance. Now, we can only make ourselves comfortable and watch all this mess. Every day it becomes more exciting. An absurd mixture of comic and tragic, grotesque and farce. That is just the prelude...</p>",

                "Continut": "<p><strong>Moldova is 80% Russia, if we refer to the television. These results from the official data that Nicolae Damaschin (vice president of the Audiovisual Coordination Council) presented in an interview for Free Europe: “80% of the audiovisual content on the market in the Republic of Moldova comes from the Russian Federation and is in Russian – 80%. Whose rights are affected, who is in minority, who is put in unfair conditions? A TV station from the Republic of Moldova cannot make a program that could be compared with one made by the big TV stations from the countries which invest in a program millions of euro.”</strong></p>\r\n<p>Nicolae Damaschin explains also the mechanism of “creating” the Moldovan television from retransmissions: “The Audiovisual Code provides such a notion as its own product, local product, and retransmission. Frequently it is made a contract for retransmission of the station, regardless of the country the station comes from, an agreement is made as these shows are purchased, which ruins the concept of full retransmission, and makes them purchased. I purchased 1,2,3,4 shows, respectively it is my property and it falls under the concept of \"own product\" aired.”</p>\r\n<p>Not only that we have to choose between Russian broadcasts, but also the money from advertising go to Russia, because the shows should be paid. I have already written that Moldovan journalists lose the most from this. Perhaps those who complain now have to do with other areas, not journalism. Otherwise why cry that you have to produce a show, that you have to work? Do you just want to fill a space between 5 programs from Russia without a proper reward? Not to say that advertising money would remain in Moldova and would not go to Kremlin, forming a vicious circle.</p>\r\n<p>How could Moldova become an European country when its citizens are 80% brainwashed by the Russian televisions? It almost seems normal to us that the Russian ambassador, Farit Muhametsin, gets together with Sevciuk to organize the election for the State Duma of Russia, provoking Moldovan authorities. It also seems normal to us that the Russian foreign affairs minister, Lavrov, declares that Ukraine want to attack Crimea. So what’s the deal, it it attacks eventually? Isn’t Crimea taken from Ukraine with Russian tanks? Isn’t it normal for them to want it back? Russian officers occupy your territories, then through propaganda explain to you that actually they are innocent victims, not occupiers. Russian propaganda sometimes works better than the tanks.</p>\r\n<p>We are the Bessarabian district of the Russian Federation, as long as the broadcasting will remain the same. The story about the market monopolization we will talk another time, it is a special subject. Although, what could we talk about when the content of Moldovan televisions is 80% Russian? Are we blind to figure out who monopolized us?</p>",

                "Continut": "<p>Last week, a fact that is not at all negligible took place at the level of the pro-European right wing opposition: PLDM, PAS, PDA signed a cooperation agreement in order to achieve a common candidate as a President: a chance for a capable candidate, eventually, to enter the second round and, maybe, win the presidential election. However, the absence of PPEM from the settlement, and the compromises made to obtain such a result, doubled by the acceptance of the Andrei Năstase’s formula that is free of tasks (to play alone, having no owner, from alliances of conjecture to protests in the street, along with Dodon and Usatîi), threatens the chances of coherence of this belated and weakened venture.</p>\r\n<p>Even so, I wanted to note this major step that showed an important force of negotiation and a capacity to compromise from PAS and PLDM, of the last, especially, in the conditions of assertion as an opposition party and detachment of the Vlad Filat’s legacy. With Viorel Cibotaru, its third president, PLDM is shaking off hardly the legacy, attacks and disruptions, prominent members of the public administration, who were bought individually or pressured to change their appurtenance, lack of funding and the need of devotion as an opposition party fighting to preserve its main asset – party organizations. This step is a welcoming one, as an appropriate level of ambition to the current timing of the electoral competition and political context.</p>\r\n<p>With the possibility of a common presidential candidate – if it is reached, eventually through import from outside the parties, from the civil society (if, again, will be the case) – the alliance formula of three may be an interesting beginning. Putting aside all the talk about early elections, which I consider impossible to launch and a target bound to fail, which discredits those who assume such an objective. The government goes on well, indubitably, which is recognized and welcomed by all the institutions and external partners, funding and the agreement with IMF was reached, first installment of the loan from Romania is coming next week.</p>\r\n<p>However, the competition is harsh and one candidate from PDM (even Adrian Candu) could be an important competitor and PL with Mihai Ghimpu or Anatol Şalaru well calibrated on the unionist platform and taking advantage of the latest opinion polls and of a better promotion of this fact. In addition, this only for the pro-European right wing electorate. Because, on the left-wing, PSM and Igor Dodon enjoys the entrance in the second round from now on and is awaiting the move of Renato Usatîi, who could change the percentage and the chances of a second leftist and populist candidate in the second round (some say that there is no place for another leftist candidate, I still support the idea that there is time and exists an entrance strategy of those two pro-Russian candidates in the final round).</p>\r\n<p>It is possible to have, in addition, many other minor candidates, who will take votes from the others. False candidates and clones are used long ago, especially on the right political spectrum. In addition, the European integration subject is not suitable anymore and doesn’t even bring votes, each will have to come up with a different identity. Here I mean the right wing. The opposition has a cohesive message, which is made more credible by the disappearance of Leancă from the team, in the case it is not slipped too far to populism or to excessive claim to street manifestations, that have already tired.</p>\r\n<p>The power has two themes: action and political recovery by PD, mostly, respectively the unionism, if embraced by PL. Unless the subject of unionism would be embraced also by the pro-European opposition, with a suitable candidate coming from the civil society and capable to raise votes from the unionism supporters. For the rest, remains a vacant leftist space, an unknown space where the crowd of new candidates may only modify the number of percentage obtained in a scrolling step by Dodon.</p>\r\n<p>As for Renato Usatîi, the stake of the candidate for presidential is much higher. It is between life and death. Bălți did not become a development light, nor an oasis of contentment, and the mayor Usatîi – does anybody remember that this boy in the service of snoring populism, for show, is still a mayor and has to run an administration to benefit the people that elected him? – He owes them. Therefore, the absence from the presidential run or a stuffed candidate could lead to the collapse of the party and the support for the political formation until it gets to enter even the Parliament. The fate of the anti-system party, of the populist and vocal speech is cruel when the leader has an administrative function with visible (and particularly inactivity!) activity. That’s why the serious candidature is a duty of life and death … policy for Usatîi!</p>\r\n<p>By then, remains August 27 and 31, symbolic, that will mark the positioning of the candidates and the parties. Who welcomes and defends the independence, who, also, greet it, but discuss it, the one who claim that defend it, but really are fighting for connecting the Republic of Moldova to the retinue of the former parent state, Moscow, in the Eurasian integration formulas of Russia, who disputes it with full rights, from the positions of functional incapacity of the Republic of Moldova or its oligarchization, while others dispute the strategic focus for the sake of … the fight with the alleged oligarch that captured the state. And who celebrates the Romanian language as the state language of the Republic of Moldova.</p>\r\n<p>As I said, in the previous editorial how much is to learn from the informational war of Russia in the world and from the last episode that Romania went through – Romanian traffickers of Ukrainian arms for the Islamic state terrorists from the west. Let us see how much and what shows the informational war in the Republic of Moldova during the electoral campaign. And what other surprises are being prepared for us.</p>\r\n<p>I left not by chance at the end the subject of the cancellation-postponement of the presidential elections. I hear about it almost 7 months in Chisinau, practically since occurred the procedural cancel of the previous Constitution adoption – a gesture of the Constitutional Court that, with all my friendship for Alexandru Tănase, I am not stopping to contest him. In any country of the world, once established the elections’ date, it is imposible to go back to such electoral process, except for an emergency situation. But in the Republic of Moldova, I learned that you shouldn’t never say „never”!</p>",

                "Continut": "<p>On the heated reactions of the media from Romania and of the Republic of Moldova officials regarding the exercises made by the Russian army and by the alleged “pacemakers” that de facto occupied the separatist region of Transnistria without the permission of the host country, ignoring the repeated calls to withdraw the troops and weapons and leave the region, the Embassy of the Russian Federation in Bucharest reacted on their web site. It should be noted that the reactions of the officials from Chisinau were ignored, while the officials from the MoD and MFA from Chisinau were defied by the Russian Embassy in Chisinau that refused to present his military attaché to give answers and sent ridiculously its unannounced military exercises made in the security zone without the approval of the Joint Control Commission, together with the separatists troops and marking the aquatic landing and forcing the Dniester with armored personnel carrier.</p>\r\n<p>This time, the explanation sent to Bucharest ( why is used the answer to the Romanian media and not the reply directly to the officials of the Republic of Moldova, towards whom exist commitments, treaties, shamelessly violated agreements by Moscow) is a reference to taunt against Romanian media: the exercises are antiterrorist, it’s trucks not tanks, and we are protecting this part of the Republic of Moldova from terrorists, respectively the famous deposits of weapons from Cobasna!!! Moreover, the diplomatic authors make fun of the Romanian media: “Our attention was drawn by some alarming news from the Romanian media dedicated to the military exercises that took place recently in Transnistria indicating the fact that some authors are in contradiction with the history and the military terminology, interpreting very openly the concept «annexation» […] and using, as openly, propagandistic clichés. By confusing armored transport trucks with tanks, they deliberately use the cliché «Russian tanks» as a synonym for «Russian threat». Thus, the authors are misleading their readers. As it is said in the proverbs of many nations, the devil lies in the detail”, is shown in the official statement of the Russian Embassy in Bucharest.</p>\r\n<p>Furthermore, the Russian diplomats pointed out that the only purpose of the Russian-Transnistrian applications is to defend an eventual terrorist attack on the ammunition depot from Cobasna. These ammunitions would be an easy prey for the terrorists that have already made targets in “EU, Russia, Thailand and USA”. The Russian diplomacy underlines, in the statement, that these munitions are a legacy of the Cold War in which were implicated the states of the Warsaw Pact and NATO. Therefore, they suggest that Russia is not responsible for the munitions that are on the territory of the Republic of Moldova and Russia is not doing anything else than protecting these munitions from the international terrorism! Obviously, without the request of the Republic of Moldova or any kind of permission from it!</p>\r\n<p>I think that this completely undiplomatic and provoking approach requires some explanations, until appears a diplomat in the embassy that will take over, only if not everyone is expecting the arrival of the new ambassador and some communicators are doing their job excessively voluntary. Firstly, the depot from Cobasna had the possibility to be moved entirely, while in Chisinau exists an installation to damage the old munition that could have solved the case 10 years ago. Then, maintaining such a thing in the separatist region, that permits “guard, protection” and even “exercises against terrorist attacks”, is a cheap motivation that became outdated a long time ago, anyway discordant with the repetitive request of the Republic of Moldova to withdraw the troops and weapons and the replacement of the auto-assumed mission by Russia with a mission of the European police that is really multinational. </p>\r\n<p>Secondly, the communicator of the Russian Embassy from Bucharest is making fun of us! He and the one that authorizes the posting on their web site should be retreated! So we have photos with the Dniester forcing by armored carriers, that are doing offensive exercises against the right side of the Dniester, that is under the control of the authorities of the Republic of Moldova, and the embassy is telling us about trucks and “antiterrorist exercises”? Skipping the oddness of protection against terrorist actions with … trucks. I would be very curious to find out how that scenario looks and what the efficiency of these actions is.</p>\r\n<p>In fact Russia and its troops of every category defies the host country, the Republic of Moldova, acts like in a occupied region and violates all the agreements and treaties moving Russian troops illegally located and training the illegal separatist troops, even miming aggression and forcing of the Dniester towards Chisinau. Shaking spirits does not help at all, especially with a nervous Ukraine and with a presence of the Russian troops behind this state, which is on war with Russia in Donbas and the frustration after the annexation of Crimea and after the challenges and the deployments of the Russian troops that announce war on a large scale. In addition, the peace initiatives are undoubtedly doomed to failure with such manifestations on the ground. Maybe the Russian MFA may take the issue, both in report with the Embassy from Bucharest and the Russian MoD that plans and authorizes these illegal exercises.<strong></strong></p>",

                "Continut": "<p>As you all know, together with IMAS Chisinau and deschide.md, Center for Conflict Prevention and Early Warning that I manage, conducted an opinion poll and a study at 25 years since the Independence of the Republic of Moldova. We wanted to see how <strong>the identity elements</strong> of the citizens of the Republic of Moldova look today, reports to the Independence, pride and reasons to be proud of the achievements of the past 25 years, what worked, what did not work, <strong>community spirit, societal cohesion and perspectives of the Republic of Moldova.</strong></p>\r\n<p>I was interested to study 3 elements, especially: <strong>societal cohesion</strong>, the elements that determine the cohesion; <strong>characteristics of the population and citizens; fears, alarms and credible threat elements</strong> that determine / can cause cohesion by defining the foe-enemy-threats perceived jointly. In addition, the conclusions deserve to be drawn, especially since the results were compared with the last study of its kind done in Chisinau in 2005.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Societal characteristics</strong> after 25 years are marked by <strong>confusion, ambiguity, obscurity, incoherency, inconsistency </strong>of those questioned. It is noticed on all levels. On the first point, that of <strong>societal cohesion</strong>, the community and population of Moldova proves that it is not an <strong>ethnic nation</strong>, leaving the trend registered in 2005, it is not a <strong>civic nation</strong>, but is characterized by a peculiar form of <strong>“state nationalism”</strong>. Thus, the element of cohesion is <strong>citizenship</strong>, particularly. Also, the state symbolism appears as a common element of community’s perception. Place of birth, local-regional identity goes after the perceived and declined identity, while the things related to the <strong>“right of blood”</strong> - history, religion, culture, ethnicity, nationality - went down to the marginal level of perception and self-identification. It should be noted also that <strong>European identity</strong> is still unclear, but it is present and growing.</p>\r\n<p>The <strong>cohesion of population</strong> is given by the <strong>state’s existence</strong>. By the <strong>citizenship </strong>(something given, not a choice) and by the birth place and where lives/live the parents (a datum). It is a <strong>state cohesion</strong>, not a <strong>national</strong> one, nor a <strong>civic</strong> one.</p>\r\n<p>The community is <strong>unintegrated</strong>, societal cohesion is at insignificant levels, unconvincing after 25 years of Independence. Moreover, further polls show a paradoxical <strong>behavior of the majority</strong>, <strong>minority like behavior</strong>, of a discriminated and unhappy community, insecure, a minority into an empire, not a majority at home. This is probably due to affective and historical memory, existence vices in the former Empire, continuous addiction to the metropolis or, even, because of the undetachment from the metropolis.</p>\r\n<p>Moreover, <strong>resentments and perceptions </strong>continue to show positive discrimination, or if you want a <strong>domination of Russian and Russian-speaking minorities from the majority - better positions, social favorability</strong> (and amid a traditional space of tolerance and the lack of cohesion and internal will of the majority to feel at home). The answers to questions related to <strong>ethnic relations</strong> show this. This and other structural elements of the respondents to various questions of the survey shows that we do not have to do with the birth of a <strong>civic nation, </strong>and elements of <strong>proto-agrarian nation,</strong> after Hobsbawm and Gelner's criteria, captured by Iulian Fruntaşu in \"Ethno-political history of the Republic of Moldova\", faded and disappeared. <strong>Societal cohesion is weak, perception and sense of community</strong> are inconclusive, unconvincing, and it's unlikely that we might create a future.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Secondly,</strong> the good news is that we are dealing with a <strong>European country and European citizens.</strong> The options at <strong>individual identity</strong> show this. We have an <strong>idealistic population inclined towards democratic values and components.</strong> Defining individual features that are seen (and in comparison with previous 2005 studies) for Moldovan citizens: disappointed, pessimistic, hopeless, seeking individual solutions, not collective ones. Idealistic, open to ideas, projects, new visions, open to re-energize the effort to build a common project.</p>\r\n<p>Thereby, respondents noted in the <strong>gains chapter in the last 25 years</strong>, primarily, <strong>rights and freedoms</strong> from the fundamental formula of <strong>democracy and human rights (so fundamental values).</strong> It is true that from far, the first position is free circulation, but immediately appear the right of expression, freedom of speech, media freedom, electoral rights (to vote and to be elected). In second place, paradoxically, <strong>access to technology</strong>. <strong>Economic freedom and economic rights</strong> - market economy, privatization, freedom to do business - is third. Finally, only the fourth <strong>component is pragmatic, mercantile, consumerist</strong> - access to goods and products. It is a good structure of the characteristics of Moldovan population, which rises the optimism.</p>\r\n<p>Finally, <strong>on the third level</strong>, I was interested to study the <strong>collective fears</strong>, i.e. practically the <strong>perception of external threats</strong>. We are talking about a <strong>very low perception</strong> of common threats, so about placement on the last positions of the concerns of those fears. Terrorism, migration, they are at the bottom of the table, which shows that, unlike the Europeans, the average citizen in Moldova has <strong>another priority agenda, distinctive one</strong>, because of individual needs and problems, family-related, life, survival, internal problems and solutions are primarily individual, not collective. On the other hand, it should be noted that increased the <strong>perception of threat from Transnistria</strong>, probably in the current context, with two components: <strong>direct threat</strong>, given by the recent military exercises and threatening an unfavorable solution by forcing / imposing solutions by Chisinau unilateral concessions.</p>\r\n<p>Altogether, we have a population in waiting mode, with poor societal cohesion, with relatively divided expectations and optimism for future, without hope, waiting an idea, a leader, a vision and a project. This is the radiography for Moldova today, at 25 years after the State’s Independence.</p>",

                "Continut": "<p>In fact, what did you actually expect? Did you really wish a peaceful, civilised holiday, where the police would be dressed in festive uniforms, where todays “crooks” would merge with the rest of the people? Come on… Be serious...</p>\r\n<p>From the start, I feel obligated to tell you that I am not a fan of this kind of events. I do have a repulsion towards parades, especially military ones. But in a conversation that I led five years ago, someone told me that for the army and other parties that are participating in this defile, it is an opportunity to get out of the shadows, to feel proud about what they are doing. These were the exact words told by the officer I know, whom I met in PMAN five years ago, gaudy as a peacockin a brand new uniform. It happened in the middle of the rehearsal. He told me that finallythey would have the opportunity to be seen by the people, to be known that they exist, that they received, with the occasion of this defile, uniforms and got out of numbness. In few words, the man was really satisfied, inspired and his eyes were sparkling even brighter than the epaulets on his uniform. Since that day, I gave a break. After all, if such an event makes at least someone happy, it has the right to exist, especially because we really need army, police, firefighters, etc. etc.</p>\r\n<p>However,let us get back to what happened on August 27th, in Chisinau. First, let us talk about that improvised VAP scene (“A” – from Arrogant, not “I” – from important): you need to know that our government is not original. Everywhere they install “official stands”. For example, this is how the one from France looked like.</p>\r\n<p><img class=\"img-responsive\" title=\"\" src=\"/images/cms-image-000000268.jpg\" alt=\"\" align=\"\" /></p>\r\n<p>The famous crowd baths à la Gorby, with his well-known statement “Where closer?” are historic and will remain exceptionally for years ahead… This tells a lot about the world we live in, but I am repeating, this is not something that defines us.</p>\r\n<p><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/8yVjwbFYQ_I\" width=\"743\" height=\"557\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></p>\r\n<p>Furthermore, things get complicated: everybody has written news about fences, police that was locked and loaded, security cordons and… tear gases. First of all tear gases, but also pictures with children and elders, watching at the event through a fence. </p>\r\n<h3>Isn’t it disappointing? Isn’t it outrageous?</h3>\r\n<p>However, if we recall everything that has happened in the last months, the appeals of the supporters of the Platform DA and of Usatai before August 27, how could it be differently? What reaction could you expect from the police that hardly resisted and settled down the assault of the Parliament, when one of them was almost strangled a couple of months ago? How many weeks lasted that hysteria on social media with the “I am not afraid” campaign? Did you watch the video of Usatai? Who spiced up the “atmosphere” before the parade? Are not the same ones who publish the same images with little children and frail old ladies behind the fence? Moreover, why not to publish such images? How not to be disturbed? I bet these pictures provoked more tears than the tear gases used by police. What a happy day for the media, including the international one! You make tabula rasa of everything that happened before this day, you upload a couple of pictures, and this is it! You have a tearful story, good enough to public in Euronews.</p>\r\n<p>In France, the fences look like this. Although, back there fighting is elsewhere and nobody calls to “soak in the toilet” the government on the Independence Day.</p>\r\n<p><img class=\"img-responsive\" title=\"\" src=\"/images/cms-image-000000267.jpg\" alt=\"\" /></p>\r\n<p>Is this not acceptable? Of course it is. Did the police reacted excessively? Probably, but I am not sure at all. You should consider the fact that the policeman from the cordon is also a human and I do not think that he would like to be strangulated as his colleague a couple of months ago? Do they seem like peaceful spectators?</p>\r\n<p><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/m5FThaDGNNw\" width=\"743\" height=\"435\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></p>\r\n<p>I did not think that I would agree with Dodon, but in this case, I must do that… Or maybe this was the purpose?</p>\r\n<p>I assure you, my dears, the media space from the Republic of Moldova is a continuous circus, including what you can read on the social media. Absurdistan. I am afraid that in the near future, to talk with someone senile, I would have to knock at the doors of a psychiatric facility…</p>\r\n<p>In the end, I would like to tell you about the most beautiful and elegant form of protest: that no one would come! Just imagine: the VAP in their pen, armed police, important guests, parade going on, but in the square – NOBODY.</p>",

                "Continut": "<p>I saw on Sunday, at that time I was in Chisinau, the interview of the U.S. Ambassador in Chisinau, James Pettit, given to the public TV channel Moldova 1, which provoked so many disputes and hurt the sentiments of so many Romanians in the Republic of Moldova and Romania also. I admit that I felt a concern, discomfort and I approached this subject with an extreme restraint, feeling very unpleasant to comment these affirmations. I approached in the first phase the strategy of not submitting these opinions which I am sure the Ambassador regrets profoundly today. However, the subject inflamed the public opinion from both shores of Prut, I think it is normal to analyze calmly and cold-blooded and have prompt clarifications all of us.</p>\r\n<p>Firstly, principled, I have a principled retain to discuss and dispute publicly the subjects when are making fundamental mistakes the allies and partners. I leave apart the opinions, which are free ones, but otherwise, the strategic American partner (of Romania), the allies from NATO and the EU partners are in a relation where exist ways and means, adequate stuff who can be approached, as their diplomats. I do not think that the most appropriate attitude is to criticize openly and out loud in the public space. The clarifications could be made behind closed doors.</p>\r\n<p>On the other hand, I should recognize that in this situation, we have to deal with a set of affirmations with an impact in the public space that could be interpreted differently, each of them being unfavorable to the Ambassador. Not knowing he history of the place where you are accredited, after a year and a half since being named, is already an evaluation criteria. However, not taking into account the sensibility and the disputes that create major divergences in the society, which make you the mean of internal politics' disputes on the eve of elections in the host country, is more questionable.</p>\r\n<p>His Excellency Pettit felt into a trap. I do not know who pushed him here and what major influence of the diplomatic space, environment or his friends from post-Soviet space where he was on duty, determined him to have these principles and, especially, to express them publicly and so definitely, but this idea was very inadequate. If the Republic of Moldova is already in a storm for 25 years since the Independence from USSR, if it is the center of a geopolitic turmoil between East and West, if it is the subject of local disputes of the pro and against Plahotniuc, respectively on the subject of control or a \"captive state\", Mr. Pettit succeeded to bring forefront a new dispute that divides the society, the identity one, therefore creating a major space of confusion in the pre-election period that fades away the most important current problems: the Russian military threat, infringement of the international rights in the Eastern Europe, change of frontiers in Europe by the armed forces, the revizionism, Transnitrian split, robbing the country of its resources through smuggling and hidden thefts in the Transnistrian region. Instead his statements throw a smokescreen that covers the realities and the options for which are called to decide the citizens of the Republic of Moldova on October 30.</p>\r\n<p>I don't want to talk about the position of the Ambassador Pettit at the Department of State and his marks or how is he viewed. The elements were, unfortunately, transparent for those who wanted to see them. I want to point out only one thing until the formal comfirmation of the Departament of State: the interview presents the opinion of the Ambassador, while the point of view of USA is reflected by the statement of the President Obama which was ignored by certain people who are greedy to generalise individual opinions. Deschide.md presented other American diplomatic opinions expressed in Bucharest imediately after the outbreak of the dispute that became scandal.</p>\r\n<p>President Barack Obama said: <a href=\"http://www.state.gov/secretary/remarks/2016/08/261274.htm\" target=\"_blank\">\"For the past quarter-century, the United States has stood squarely behind your pursuit of democratic reform and EU integration, your efforts to strengthen the rule of law and fight corruption, and your desire to ensure greater prosperity and security for every citizen. Today and in the years to come, we will continue to support the best interests and aspirations of the Moldovan people, as well as your work towards a resolution of the Transnistrian settlement process that preserves the sovereignty and territorial integrity of your country within its internationally recognized borders. \"</a></p>\r\n<p>That is all. Identity references do not appear, nor the historical one, nor other controversial subjects. That is why I would call this episode an accident, an unhappy moment to which the Ambassador was exposed on the recommendation of friends with a mission, most likely. I am not talking about the mandate, the recommendations he got when he was certified as the representative to the Republic of Moldova, it is the duty of  the Department of State and the host country to evaluate the diplomat and his representation in Chisinau. However, the elements of identity, the controversial elements that create disputes and emphasize splits as those in conflict at the political level are never approached by a diplomatic representative. Moreover, for an ambassador with experience, in the international environment where not following the international law is a threat to national security, such an point of view open to interpretation should be avoided.</p>\r\n<p>Indeed, according to the UN Charter, to deny the sovereignty of states, free will of their citizens is impunity. Or give judgments on the will and whether a possible decision \"to join Romania\", how says Mr. Ambassador, sovereign actors Romania and Moldova, may be a wrong opinion, but can be interpreted as meaning to revision rules of international law. The prospect of the two countries is established by their citizens, now or in the future and is not subject to any speculations or desires of a diplomat or another. And when the inspiratory spirit of the approach has an agenda, managing to determine such public statements from an US Ambassador, the consequences are as they are and are beared by everyone in relation to their responsibility.</p>\r\n<p>And thus, on the eve of the holiday of August 31, the holiday of Our Romanian Language in Chisinau, instead give space and attention to this festive forgotten event, too discreetly celebrated, we are talking on a topic that was not supposed to exist. I proposed an editorial on this holiday, I had a comment on the very good speech of the President Nicolae Timofti for the Independence Day, both in PMAN and the reception dedicated to this day, however, with all the start to overlook a mistake, launched by the Ambassador Pettit, divided public opinion in two states, one where he is on duty and the neighbor one, and needs urgent clarifications. Therefore, I invite the Ambassador Pettit to participate in the festivities on the Language holiday in Chisinau for a quick reconciliation with an overwhelming part of the state's citizens.</p>",

Also, military drills in the Black Sea were amplified with the number of weapons, munitions and  troops done in the Eastern Ukraine.</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong></strong>The aggression was intensified by a so-called capture, at th at the borders of Crimea annexed by Russia, of a car with three terrorists on board belonging to the Ukrainian military forces \"GUR\", as announced Russian Federation, that planned to plant bombs and attack the airport and the bus station from Simferopol, the capital of the half island. As evidence, the Russian side presented with three kilograms of explosive found in the spare of the car and a video \"confession\" of one of the presumed terrorists, which was the alleged head of the interrupted operation by the capture of August 12.</p>\r\n<p>Oh well, yesterday Ukrainian press received data that brings to light this threat of Russian services and the information warfare launched by the Russian media, that also includes the visit of Vladimir Putin in Crimea and the meeting of a local Security council.  The news channel \"Dozhd\" broadcast statements of the wife of Andrey Zahtyei, the interview took over by the entire Ukrainian media along with the materials of Ukrainian security services \"SBU\" and video analyses of the broadcast declaration by the Russian media including European partners, which not sustained Russian allegations and declined the alleged evidence.</p>\r\n<p>Therefore, the wife of the terrorist's boss from the Russian story declared that her husband was tortured by the Russian services FSB and forced him to make that recording where he is acknowledging his terrorism charges. In that recording, Andrey Zahktyei looks at the side of the camera, reading a text, but his reading was interrupted a couple of times, and he claims on that tape that he planned the terrorist attacks in Crimea half-island. From that recording broadcast by the Russian press on August 12, we can also understand that the culprit admits that he works for Ukrainian intelligence services and he searched and determined already potential locations for planting bombs with major consequences for the civilians in Crimea, on Simferopol airport. </p>\r\n<p>The Russian newspaper \"Kommersant\" published the official accusations addressed to Zakhtyei that includes only inappropriate conduit and disturbing public order, despite admitting his terrorist activity. </p>\r\n<p>The authorities from Kiev vehemently denied, since news broadcast about \"terrorists\" capture, any implication in this activities, they accused and denounced the confrontations aimed to relaunch a large scale war in the Eastern Ukraine and Northern Crimea. The Ukrainian citizen, Zakhtyei is a minor criminal that fled to Russia five years ago - long before the annexation of Crimea - never serve in any kind of Ukrainian services, and his disappearance was due running from creditors, loan-sharks and his partners from the Ukrainian criminal network.</p>\r\n<p>Oksana Zakhtyei, the wife of the assumed terrorist, claims for the Russian channel \"Dozhd\" that her husband is innocent, that he is in transporting business and he is a cab driver and now he just drove his clients to Crimea, where they were supposed to arrive. The torture evidence appear even on the recording, despite the make-up, Andrei Zahktyei presenting signs of swelling and pressure sores on his face from beating, his lips were beading and his fists covered with bruises. Oksana said that she was arrested as well at the apartment, she has been seen by her neighbors, taken to the police under the accusation of terrorist complicity. Otherwise she knows nothing else from the events about her husband. </p>",

                "Continut": "<p>This week took place the Annual Meeting of Romanian Diplomacy, an annual occasion for reformation and for establishing the most important directions of the external policy of Romania. Moreover, the meeting was more relevant as the most important persons who are linked to the establishing of the foreign policy and its implementing, who are deciding the external policy of Romania, have spoken out. While the beginning of the week was marked by the disputes that implied the US Ambassador in Chisinau, James Pettit, and his thoughts regarding the prospects of union (beyond not knowing the history and the sensible topics of identity, for which President Nicolae Timofti gave the most accurate and clear replies), I gathered what was said about the Republic of Moldova to remove speculation and false propaganda, triumph and dragging Romania in false disputes with USA, in the minds of more hotheaded commentators and analysts. </p>\r\n<p>In this way, proximity like that we meet at everyone involved is to support the Republic of Moldova on <strong>security, stability, reforms, democratization, rule of law, maintaining the European path and re-establishing the credibility of Moldova. </strong>Therefore, <strong>the President Klaus Johannis </strong>stated in front of Romanian diplomats: \"Also in the Eastern Neighbourhood, Romania needs to set the <strong>stability of Modova and its plans to join the European Union</strong> as priorities. We approached the issue pragmatically this year, including through the first tranche of a 150 million euros loan, we constructively supported <strong>the reform engine </strong>in Moldova. <strong>Re-establishing its credibility</strong> to foreign actors, especially the European Union is an objective Chisinau needs to prioritize and believe in, be it local administration, the Government or the President of Moldova, even after the upcoming presidential elections. You will keep supporting this efforts in Chisinau <strong>to continue implementing EU reforms</strong>. On this basis, I reassure the pro-European political forces in Moldova of our full support.\" <strong>The Prime Minister Dacian Ciolos</strong> stated that: \"We actively continue the efforts to promote and support the <strong>Republic of Moldova’s European integration aspirations</strong>, having here a pragmatic approach. In the first half of the year, we took actions to support the <strong>stabilization of the political situation and regaining trust of the international partners</strong> of the Republic of Moldova. (…) <strong>Romania is now guarantor of Republic of Moldova’s credibility</strong>, by the way it addressed this pragmatic relationship with the Republic of Moldova, this year. We have the premises for the association of other external financiers.\" <strong>In addition, the Foreign Minister of Romania, Lazar Comanescu</strong>: \"The Republic of Moldova is and will remain an <strong>indisputable priority of external policy</strong>. We will keep providing <strong>substantial support</strong> where it is really needed to the extent of our possibilities. Our message is a clear one: for the <strong>democratic development and prosperity of Republic of Moldova</strong>, to benefit all its citizens, the reforms have to be sustainable, credible and irreversible.\"</p>\r\n<p>It is true that President's speech had another peculiarity, referring to the security situation in Republic of Moldova, underlining: \"In <strong>Transnistria</strong> are intensifying, without justification, <strong>military exercises with the participation of Russian forces</strong>, without seeing any progress amid regulating the Transnistrian issue. This, taking into consideration that Moldova is heading this fall to the <strong>first direct Presidential elections</strong>, after a long time. (...)\"</p>\r\n<p>Anyhow, the President was the one who insisted on bilateral programs: \"It’s vital that the Romanian Government keeps the <strong>bilateral projects</strong> working and consistent. They have an important role in leading to <strong>modernization and connecting Moldova to the EU standards</strong>, including through <strong>development assistance</strong> from our Ministry of Foreign Affairs. I’m referring to finalizing Iasi-Ungheni-Chisinau gas pipeline, electricity and transportation connections, institutional development projects in Moldovan administration as well as projects with social and economic impact and judicial and education assistance.\"</p>\r\n<p>Also, concerning particular remarks, <strong>Prime Minister Dacian Ciolos</strong> insisted on the financial-economic component and European reforms: \"<strong>Progress</strong> has been achieved with respect to the <strong>Roadmap</strong> undertaken by Chisinau Cabinet to the European Union, a staff –level agreement with IMF was concluded, the European Commission is preparing the release of the financial assistance and may propose micro-financial assistance if the Republic of Moldova fulfills the actions agreed with the Monetary Fund. (…)\"</p>\r\n<p>These are the concerns and this is the official policy of the Romanian state. And if there are still doubts, as Romanian Embassy in Bucharest sent the US foreign policy lines insisting that \"anything more than these lines is not the American state policy\", referring openly to the thoughts of American Ambassador in Chisinau - the US Ambassador in Bucharest, Hans Klemm taking de facto the role of Ambassador in Chisinau, on public communication component, at least until December, when James Pettit's mandate ends - <strong>President Klaus Johannis </strong>was even more sarcastic, specifically, saying in his speech: \"At the same time, I want to point out that, as a President, I have assumed to give <strong>an honest and proper direction of our foreign policy</strong>, showing confidence, predictability and therefore stronger links with our partners. Some believe in being honest and transparent in foreign policy, there are risks of image or perception of weakness. I do not believe that. On the contrary, it is a sign of reliability and a source of credibility and power in the long term. From this perspective, I can say clearly <strong>what will not happen during my mandate. Romania will never play unfair games, will not use double language under the pretext of diplomacy, will not compromise the values and will not consider acceptable the violation of international law.</strong>\"</p>\r\n<p>I think the above close fully the major subject of informational war by Russia in Chisinau about the union that is being prepared secretly by Romania, announced for about 20 years as upcoming by all the trumpets of Russian propaganda - as in the fable about Peter and the Wolf - but that never happened. Instead, Russian troops and munitions are doing very well in Tiraspol, under various alleged reasons like - munitions cannot be taken, Ukrainians are not letting me or they could explode, but I have not accepted in situ device for casing munitions, offered by USA and remained a lot of years in Chisinau, then if there are munitions, I need to protect them, if there is a conflict, I am a peacekeeper, isn't it - and Russia does not assume even its own responsibilities, aggression in Eastern Europe, speaking, for example, in Donbas, about separatists and Kiev's negotiations with them, Moscow staying stainless and ingenuous, only good for a guarantor status, \"along with France and Germany\".</p>",

                "lead": "Shortly, the electoral campaign will begin for the presidential elections from October 30th, 2016. The parties that are governing and those from the opposition named their favorites. The protagonists of the voting are doing the last preparations before the start. We will also have independent candidates. I believe they will succeed at gathering the needed number of votes. The staffs are working hard on the electoral programs and the collection of signatures. Although, the crowd at the presidency is a huge one, there are few real candidates. Anyway, the excitement is there and this will make the show interesting. However, after everything ends and the decor will be removed, what will remain for us. This is the question. Let us analyze the purposes and stakes of the presidential aspirants, and, especially of those who are in the backstage.",
                "Continut": "<p>If we take as a reference the position of the candidates and also the parties they are representing, in the recent polls we can identify several candidates who can win or influence the final result. To begin with, we operate with a longer list at which we will come back later. Taking into account the surveys, analyzes and predictions, the main candidates are: Igor Dodon (PSRM), Dumitru Ciubasenco (PN), Marian Lupu (PD), Andrei Nastase (PDA), Maia Sandu (PAS), Iurie Leanca (PPEM), Mihai Ghimpu (PL). I have placed the candidates on an imaginary political spectrum from left to right, realizing the relativity of this classification when it comes to parties or political leaders from our country. A first surprise on the eve of the campaign was provided by PCRM leader Vladimir Voronin, who declared the party's intention to boycott the elections. We may have other surprises, that is why we will return to the chances of candidates after September 9th, when will end the deadline for the submission of candidates.</p>\r\n<p>The main subjects of the campaign, as I was mentioning in a previous text, will be two: the corruption and the geopolitical vector. The corruption subject will be raised by the governing parties and the opposition ones. As the revelations from the public space show, allegations of corruption surrounding both the government representatives and the opposition candidates or the forces behind them. Therefore, the opposition will accuse the government of corruption, and the government, in turn, will position itself as an active fighter against corruption, bringing evidence of his opponents' involvement in corruption. The arrest and extradition of Veaceslav Platon to the authorities from Chisinau, apparently was not part of some opposition representatives' plans. The Government will use all its available resources to discredit the opponents. There will probably be new figures in the cases related to money laundering and theft of the billion. There are enough skeletons in the closet for sure. It will be interesting.</p>\r\n<p>The second subject, the geopolitical vector was present in all the electoral campaigns in the Republic of Moldova. The campaign for the presidential elections from 2016 will not be an exception. The last sociological study done by IMAS confirms the fact that the geopolitical divide is the one who continues to determine the results of the elections in the Republic of Moldova. Are we moving to West, towards European Union, by achieving the provisions of the Association Agreement, or are we returning to the Eastern zone, in the Eurasian Customs Union? After 25 years of independence the society still remains focused on the sovereignty problems, history, language.</p>\r\n<p>We may identify more factors that regulate the continuance of the geopolitical factor in the Moldovan elections. Mainly, it concerns, however, the socioeconomic development of the country. The very low standard of living of the citizens, that continues during the whole time since the independence has fueled the trends of idealization of the Soviet past. The option to return to the Eastern zone is supported by the nostalgic ones, who in turn can be divided into two groups: those who from the beginning were against the dissolution of the USSR and those disillusioned by the course and results of the reforms. The nostalgic camp, over time, was completed by the former Soviet nomenclature, representatives of national minorities and cohabiting ethnic groups, as well as citizens complaining about wealth and uncertain prospects. The nostalgic camp, over time, was completed by the former Soviet nomenclature, representatives of national minorities and different cohabiting ethnic groups and citizens not happy with wealth and uncertain prospects.</p>\r\n<p>They want a greater proximity to Russia as a direct descendant of the defunct USSR. Massive pro-Russian spirit is maintained by the propaganda of the Russian media, which seized, according to some analyzes, is about 80 percent of the information space between the Dniester and Prut. This managed to fully compensate for the failures of Russia in foreign policy, especially after the annexation of Crimea and causing conflict in southeast Ukraine. All these include the basic electorate of PSRM, PN and partly PCRM. By the way, the Communists boycotting the presidential elections substantially increases the chances of Igor Dodon and partly of Marian Lupu. According to recent polls, electoral pool is the pro-Russian for more than 40 percent of Moldovan citizens. We must admit, it is a very high percentage, considering the precarious internal situation in Russia today, and image crisis in the international arena  the Kremlin goes through.</p>\r\n<p>The other group consists of European integration supporters. They, as a rule are from the ranks of local intellectuals, youth and the active population. Some of them who complain about delaying reforms, lack of good changes and prospects at home, emmigrated. The hard core of the followers of European integration are the unionists. They see unification with Romania as the shortest way to European Union membership. The Union - a goal that has experienced periods of ebbs and flows. After the peak lived in the early 90s of the last century, the unionism declined during the Communist period. Now we are seeing an increase in unionist options, partly because of the precarious situation in which the Moldovan society is. The latest poll shows an increase of the union followers, but not so high as speculated in some statements. The subject was re-launched with a greater intensity, by the reactions to statement of the US Ambassador in Chisinau, James Pettit. US Ambassador's declarations must be analyzed in a broader context, we notice only now that the union was returned to the agenda with a new intensity and no doubt it will be a topic of the election campaign. Some will try to fish for votes among union followers, others among their opponents.</p>\r\n<p>If we try to analyze the position of the competitors for the presidency, we see some strange things altogether. Some parties, who are pro-European at first sight advocate for early elections. I mean the PLDM, PAS and PDA. Early elections were the main requirement of most of the leadership of these parties a year ago, when the protests of the civic platform DA united them, even if PDA and PAS were to be recorded later as political parties. It should be noted that at that time all the surveys and analyzes accredited the pro-Russian parties, PSRM and PN as winners of possible earlier parliamentary elections. The paradox is that, insisting on anticipated elections the \"pro-European\" parties are bringing in fact at the governance the pro-Russian parties, which is why quotation marks were put. Now, presidential candidates from PSRM, PN, PDA, PAS are not hiding that one of the main objectives, once in the wanted position, is the challenge of the early elections. The other parties PD, PL, PPEM opt for a continuance of the process begun after the Filip government was installed namely focusing on the implementation of the Association Agreement.</p>\r\n<p>As we can see the anticipated parliamentary elections is a goal that unites both pro-Russian camp and some of those who declare themselves pro-European. The strange position occupied by these \"pro-European\"parties, as long as the result of early elections remains uncertain, and hence the country's European course. Perhaps in the option to choose the anticipated elections of the parties declared pro-European, prevails interest of a group that is trying to change the government in order to influence the investigation of the theft of billion and the trial of former Prime Minister Filat linked to it and the newest possible revelations once starting a new trial this time on the name of Veaceslav Platon.</p>\r\n<p>Not much time left until the start of the electoral campaign for the presidential election. The political subjects continue to provide more politicy than the citizens are able to consume. Handling mechanisms increase their speed. It is important to carefully follow what are the true goals and stakes of the candidates and parties and interest groups behind them. It all starts. We are watching them.</p>",

                "Continut": "<p>The presidential elections of 30th October position themselves on a way already expected by us: the one that is pushing on the first plan the pro-Russian candidates. The crowd from the right wing threatens to cannibalize the campaigns and the votes and to allow, last of all, full manifestation of pro-Russian voters, anyway more well-schooled at the voting. </p>\r\n<p>Why there is a substantial advantage for the pro-Russian nominees? Firstly, it is because there are only two of them: Igor Dodon, the President of PSRM, and Dmitri Ciubasenco, the man of Renato Usatai. The withdrawal of Vladimir Voronin from the race leads to maintain the votes between those two, and the boycott urge has reduced the effect on keeping the left wing voters, because all the electoral campaign is urging to vote, but a single boycott voice does not mean anything than the <em>abdication of communists from the electoral race,</em> disqualified for a party.  More than that: states the fact that this party does not have a presidential nominee (or the President Voronin does not want to promote the successor pupil on this occasion, but to maintain the control over the party).</p>\r\n<p>So, as long as on the left wing are two nominees, on right wing – about 5 main ones (in comparison to PDM and its counselors, I have, a very clear, evaluation that the governing party in Moldova, assumed pro-European, is perceived as right wing party. In addition, it cannot be otherwise, because the pro-European path and the reforms do not qualify in Moldova a left wing party, even if its candidate, Marian Lupu, has a confusing identity approach that can still hold him in a doctrinaire confusion).  When you share comparable votes (the last public opinion poll shows an equal report between pro-European and pro-Russian voters, with a small advantage for the pro-European side, for the first time in 2014), it is obvious that in general, each one of the pro-Russian have a better quotation than the pro-Europeans. As well as for the parties, those two from the left wing, PSRM and PN, have higher positions in the pools, their chance to enter in the second round is highly probable. </p>\r\n<p>There is another motivation, which exists a high probability that both pro-Russian nominees will ascend in the second round: gathering voters. Every public opinion poll is made on a sample that is comparable with the demographic situation from the last known opinion poll, in other words on a division of the age structure rather equal to that of the entire population. However, the capacity to gather people alters these results. For example, if voters that have more than 60 years represents 22% of the population, but are present at voting only 55% of voters from the polls, then the result will show this difference outreach. In this case, a better mobilization of this this age – most likely – leads to promotion mostly pro-Russian candidates in the second round of elections. Where the election rules are changing substantially. </p>\r\n<p>Secondly, as a probability, getting in the second tour of elections claims the votes that have been collected. From this point on, the fight between <em>government – pro-European opposition</em> is one that involves resources and media power, although the opposition is dominant and threatening to send a candidate in the second round. As the power is divided into two, maybe three – Lupu and Ghimpu, and eventually Leanca – preeminence stays with the candidate form the right wing. And here is the most interesting part of these elections: the unity that is behind the back of only one of the right wing nominees, most likely Maia Sandu, leads to getting in the second round of elections and to the probability of winning the elections. A weaker voice that is running against the power increase your chances of winning in the second round, but create difficulties to enter the second round.</p>\r\n<p>Therefore, the decision on withdrawal of Andrei Nastase and support of Maia Sandu, for real, by PDA with the help of PLDM (with organizational resource from the field), could bring a pro-European to the second round of elections. Obviously, a better option would be a single nominee from outside of the political spectrum, with better chances than Maia Sandu’s for now.  </p>\r\n<p>Will Andrei Nastase respect the agreement, that in the second round of elections, the weakest candidate to drop off? Is there the capacity of unity and working together; or the second tour of the presidential elections is already a pro-Russian business, with major costs at Bucharest for those responsible for Romania's foreign policy, the president and government (PNL)?</p>\r\n<p>The analysis is still preliminary, until September 9<sup>th</sup>, when we will already have the list of the candidates, and even more, with what support. But the stakes are set. I don’t think that Marian Lupu will accede in the second round of elections, maybe only except if in the right wing will be a chaos and a sudden disappearance of “Partidul Nostru” Party candidate. Otherwise, on October 30<sup>th</sup>, we will have two pro-Russians in the second round of elections, and on November 13<sup>th</sup>, Dodon as President of Moldova. With all the costs, that such a free choice would bring to Moldova.</p>\r\n<p>Of course we have a long way to go; however, the preeminence of the themes of the campaign will count as well. Depends on who will make the agenda and the modifications on the field. Therefore, if the main topics are geopolitical debates between East and West, the chances of a pro-European nominee, with a well led campaign, matters. There is more, a pro-European candidate in the second round of elections will be the winner of these elections. If we have to deal with the pre-eminence of an anti-Plahotniuc fight and of a captive state, the pro-European opposition would be main gainer. If the debate would be first of all about unionism or the identity debate, the winners would be the unionists and they will face each other on these bases. And so on. In other words, we still have to wait until more serious and more effective characteristics of the electoral perspectives. Let us wait also for the first polls after the final start of the nominees.</p>\r\n<p>Naturally, if on the field appear political events or direct crises, things will change proportionally. An eventual action of the Russian army on the right side of the Nistru river, with separatist banner, would functionally affect the situation as - God forbid – any destructive crises of health or security, which could, as well, fundamentally ruin the chances of the candidates of different parties. We won’t talk anymore about eventual disclosed frauds or arrests. As possible positive surprises of some unexpected nominees, this lures a lot of public support through the created emotion and the originality of their launch. To be seen.</p>",

                "Continut": "<p>Here are some excerpts from the indignation of Nastase regarding Leanca:</p>\r\n<p>- I was really thinking that this guy is a diplomat, is a schooled man, elevated </p>\r\n<p>- I feel sorry for this guy and he will be in jail</p>\r\n<p>– this person must be in prison</p>\r\n<p>– I would sentence him to the war crimes tribunal</p>\r\n<p>- this individual betrayed</p>\r\n<p>– the named Leanca, to judge me? </p>\r\n<p>- he to marry me?</p>\r\n<p>- Leanca is a hostage</p>\r\n<p>- text written at Nobil</p>\r\n<p>- Leanca is able to do anything</p>\r\n<p>I looked curiously for Iurie Leanca's comment from the social network, which has scandalized Maia Sandu Andrei Nastase, even the journalist Vasile Butnaru:</p>\r\n<p>\"As you saw the common nominee is called Maia Nastase, if we make the best of a bad job.</p>\r\n<p>I have said several times that the negotiations were mimicked and there was never wanted a sole candidate. Today there is no a single candidate of the right-wing opposition because actually he was not wanted. All that have told Maia Sandu and Andrei Nastase two weeks ago that they will come with a right candidate, was just a cheap demagoguery. These people cannot understand one simple reason: one is not given permission from the master and the other needs the job because he was jobless for several months and could not find a job after leaving the post of minister in the government PD-PCRM-PLDM. Both now play their book of life, dreamed too much to abandon this position. The problem is different: these two men who lied to people that will go with a single candidate, want to be president? They began their road to the presidency with a great hoax and a mockery to people. Now they will come to tell you that look, even announced their candidacy before the vote can still withdraw and come up with a single candidate, that is still a mockery to men. These two demagogues criticized me when I said that they mimic the negotiations and today see the truth. I think people can already make important conclusions about the seriousness of these two candidates.\"</p>\r\n<p>The text which Nastase-Sandu said that Leanca did not write it, it is ironic, with figures of speech and with humor. I've never seen anything quite so outrageous. It is the opinion of a politician who joined the campaign, nothing extraordinary, in any case a \"theater of the absurd\". But Nastase, who was known in public with phrases like \"servants of Plahotniuc\", \"let's go in the back of the club,\" \"punch your face\", \"ferrets\", \"criminals\" and says that parlance of Leanca is not of  a XXI century politician, to see how the appropriate parlance should be. I selected a few samples of his letter to Plahotniuc, without getting tired of looking expressions of speeches, more sparkling.</p>\r\n<p>A speech of a Moldovan politician from the XXI century, by Nastase, should include these terms: </p>\r\n<p>- enemy</p>\r\n<p>- foe</p>\r\n<p>- tyranny</p>\r\n<p>- to detract</p>\r\n<p>- absurdities one more disgusting  than another </p>\r\n<p>- lies</p>\r\n<p>- Empire of lies</p>\r\n<p>- factory of lies and slander</p>\r\n<p>- your shameless stupidity</p>\r\n<p>- your manipulations</p>\r\n<p>- corruption by blackmail</p>\r\n<p>- criminal schemes</p>\r\n<p>- Nazi propagandist</p>\r\n<p>- The complete lack of conscience</p>\r\n<p>- Dirt</p>\r\n<p>- papier-mâché</p>\r\n<p>- Pimp and smuggler</p>\r\n<p>- You trafficked Moldovan</p>\r\n<p>- Partner in crime</p>\r\n<p>- Your criminal schemes</p>\r\n<p>- frauds</p>\r\n<p>- Corruption and blackmail</p>\r\n<p>- You and your comrades lie</p>\r\n<p>- Press in your pocket</p>\r\n<p>- Relations with underworld</p>\r\n<p>- mobster</p>\r\n<p>- dices at the market</p>\r\n<p>- puppeteer</p>\r\n<p>-  pocket unionists</p>\r\n<p>- you have bought them with all the giblets</p>\r\n<p>- scared to death</p>\r\n<p>- your puppets</p>",

Just the other day I saw a shooting inside the National Art Museum in Chisinau, renovated on the money from Romania: I think it never looked so well. More than half of the kindergartens from Moldova were renovated from the same source, and the program is not ending this year.

That is why Dodon is trembling, for the times that will come, then he will be investigated for the robberies he committed, about was written a lot, both during the time he was Minister of Economy and after it.</p>\r\n<p>The Romanian gendarme brings reforms, unlike green men sent from Moscow and one embarrassing tip in Gagauzia. We expect them with open arms! They have a lot to repair after the communist and post-communist disaster. What else to say about the Dodon candidate? Even his friends, Voronin, Nastase, Usatai say that: he is just a tool, a traitor. Moldova has a future without Igor Dodon!</p>",

But this is only until the shuttle and all the cosmic garbage will fall on their heads, right after elections. It's true that they can choose: to fall something small, that does not kill them for good, or... I do not know why, but in such times I remember a song by <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BJhc8ToYHLw\">Pavel Kașin: „Открытый космос в ее голове”</a>...</p>\r\n<p><strong>GREAT HASTE DOES NOT MAKE GREAT WASTE  </strong>At the time that i am writing this text, there are 21 candidates that submited their intentions at the CEC! A big crowd! Let's see how many will remain at the end of the month. At the moment only two nominees, Lupu and Ghimpu, brought to CEC the necessary amount of signatures. The PD nominee <a href=\"http://www.deschide.md/en/news/political/399/PD-brand-performance--M-Lupu-brought-to-CEC-the-required-signatures-for-the-application-registration.htm\" target=\"_blank\">did it wright in the first day!</a> A stunning performance and, at first sight, a doubtful one. I mean How? How can you expose yourself in such a way? We could accuse PD of foolishness, if we could forget a small detail: the candidates will be appear on the ballot paper in the order they submitted their files (If their signatures would be validated, but is there someone who is doubting that? I assure you, they are not so stupid, that they would forge the signatures). In this way, the candidate Marian Lupu will be first on the ballot paper, and Mihai Ghimpu - the second. Wait a second, to what purpose? Don't we live in a <em>\"captive state\"</em> in which the almighty Plaha controls absolutely everything? Can we understand that he can not design machines at CEC? Its seems not a lot, and that those hypothetical votes that are connected to the position on the ballot paper are not ignored at all... For their sake, PD accepted to be <a href=\"/en/news/political/419/VIDEO--Maia-Sandu-requests-the-General-Prosecutor's-Office-to-verify-the-signatures-of-Marian-Lupu.htm\" target=\"_blank\">accused that they used their administrative machinery</a> at maximum (as if those before them did not do the same thing, or, if there would be others on their places, they would do differently...). You can see it as you want, but I see here a good sign and a touch of hope.</p>\r\n<p><strong>THE INVENTED BILLION </strong>I quote: \"[we demand] <em>The External Audit of the State Register of Voters and the State Register of Citizens, to determine the motive for the sudden raise of the voters, with over a million people, in the circumstances that the population of the Republic od Moldova is continues to decrease\"</em>, stated \"Platforma DA\" party.</p>\r\n<p>Problem Data: We have</p>\r\n<p>1) The number of voters of 2016, announced by CEC  two weeks ago: 3.237.032.</p>\r\n<p>2) The number of <a href=\"http://www.e-democracy.md/elections/parliamentary/2014/results\" target=\"_blank\">voters included in the electoral lists in 2014:</a> 2.800.827. (Note: I can not know the number announced by CEC in 2016, based on the State Register of Population, can be compared with the \"number of voters included in the electoral lists\" from 2014). </p>\r\n<p>3.237.032 – 2.800.827 = 436.205. Approximately this would be the difference (hypothetical, see the note from above). I can say that this is also a big difference, but far from a million of people. <a href=\"/ro/stiri/politic/440/Platforma-DA-sesizeaz%C4%83-partenerii-interna%C8%9Bionali-PD-inten%C8%9Bioneaz%C4%83-s%C4%83-fraudeze-alegerile.htm\" target=\"_blank\">Nastase is naturally lying</a>. Instead, I made some calculations for my own from <a href=\"http://www.registru.md/ro/date-statistice/in-profil-de-virsta\" target=\"_blank\">a list from the State Register of Population</a> and figured 3.170.202 citizens with the right to vote. Let's skip those 8.407 citizens that have over 90 years old... There is an impressive number! (Not matter how cynical we are, but the value less that 0.5%, if we apply the same absenteeism as in 2014). The obtained difference against those announced by CEC is 66.830 people. And this means about 4% using the same references as in 2014. That is how I think, the conclusions are yours to make. Or search for yourself. </p>\r\n<p><strong>THERE WILL BE NO REFERENDUM! </strong>I also do not like how Chisinau looks, even if I pass through there only once in a year. But I am against such referendums. Not because I like Chirtoaca, his last statements are more and more... spatial, let's call them this way, but I think that for the change of the administration there are elections. Usatai I like even less, but the citizens of Balti don't have any other chose but bear it, if they elected him. I would pronounce myself against a referendum even if the referendum was organised to dismiss Usatai. Democracy means responsibility! This means to assume your votes. To respect the choice of majority. But we don't know what democracy is. To what leads the referendums from the ex-Sovietic space and for what they are organised generally, we all know. The Appeal Court from Balti <a href=\"/ro/stiri/politic/557/News-ALERT--Referendumul-anti-Chirtoac%C4%83-a-c%C4%83zut.htm\" target=\"_blank\">decided that there will be no referendum</a> for Chirtoaca's dismissal. But I ask myself how many activists who asked for him, invited people to boycott the elections a year ago. And he can not overlook that <a href=\"/ro/stiri/politic/533/Scandalul-cu-angajarea-lui-Chironda-%C3%AEn-proiectul--%E2%80%9E20-de-mln-pentru-gr%C4%83dini%C5%A3e%E2%80%9D-trece-Prutul.htm\" target=\"_blank\">step that made PL relating to the salary</a> and to contractual commitments of Victor Chironda. He says that he will tip off the \"external partners\". PL alerted already the donors from Romania. They will figure it out somehow. But this is what I thinking: when i am writing you this lines, it is already midnight. And usually, in the night between Thursday and Friday I sleep only a couple of hours. More than two years. Because during the day I work on a contract for which I have a salary. And my Boss really would not like the fact that I am writing weekly synthesis when I should do something else. But enough about me. Probably in the NGO's or Public Social Funds is another arrangement. Probably a guy that takes in a month a wage from the public money, more than gets an elder for his pension, can afford to organize his days in another way. To deal with referendums, for example. I don't know, you decide. For the moment, the City Hall of Chisinau is totally disordered, inclusively cause of the referendum. Because those who sould do their job, especially the CMC, have other fights to fight.  </p>\r\n<p><strong>LA STRADA – PLAGIARISM!</strong> By the way, about NGO's. In 2012 a NGO that consumes money from the Government of France, <a href=\"http://www.fondationscelles.org/fr/\" target=\"_blank\">the Scelles Fundation</a>, wrote a rapport spread on a large scale that <a href=\"http://protv.md/stiri/social/studiu-70-dintre-femeile-din-republica-moldova-s-au-prostituat.html\">70% of Moldovan women have prostituted</a> at least once in lifetime. When asked for explications, they confess that they took the number from God knows what rapport of a unknown European Deputy (whatever, back then even Becali was an European Deputy) without checking it with any official State institurions from Moldova. Today, instead worrying, the Moldovan associates, inclusively from those scandalized back in the time, even in Paris, cooperates very well with Scelles Fundation. I told you: when you give money...   </p>\r\n<p>The past days Lilia Bicec, the authoress of the book about migration “Bumerang” was discovering with stupor a fragment from her book on <a href=\"http://stirilocale.md/iti-dau-lacrimile-povestea-de-viata-sfasietoare-a-unei-familii-a-carei-mama-a-plecat-peste-hotare.html\">a web site from the Republic of Moldova, stirilocale.md.</a> But the guilt was not of the portal. The took this fragment, indicating with fidelity the source, from an <a href=\"http://www.lastrada.md/publicatii/ebook/dosar_neoficial.pdf\">activity report</a> of an NGO, <a href=\"http://www.lastrada.md/en/\">La Strada</a>! However, the fraud is not limiting to plagiarism. That is what we read in the notes that are attached to the stolen text (p. 20): \"<em>As a result of the evaluation was convoked the multidisciplinary team which included: social assistant, mayor, sector policeman, class teacher amd the doctor that created the individual plan of intervention for every member of the family and also the working plan for the family. The members of the family are monitored monthly by visits and meetings\". </em>Of course, for this “monthly monitoring” are needed money, isn’t it so?...</p>\r\n<p><strong>THE COUNTRY OF THE DOOMED</strong> We have Valera Guma, now <a href=\"/ro/stiri/investigatiii/515/EXCLUSIV--%C3%8En-Rom%C3%A2niacondamnat-pentru-evaziune-fiscal%C4%83-%C3%AEn-RMoldovapus-%C8%99ef-pe-AUDIT-la-%E2%80%9EDrumuri%E2%80%9D.htm\">we have another one: Serioja Trocin.</a> Doomed for money laundering, fiscal evasion and smuggling in Romania, Trocin is working as the chief of the Internal Audit Service of the SOE State Administration of Roads. Was he running of the “Romanian gendarme”, isn’t that right, comrade Dodon?</p>\r\n<p><strong>MOLDOVA AT CIS</strong><strong> </strong>If you have forgotten the existence of this organization, it is time to remember it. The fact that <a href=\"/en/news/political/513/Timofti-refused-to-go-to-the-CIS-Council-of-Heads-of-States-The-burden-falls-on-Filip's-shoulders.htm\">we are still going there</a> is an absurdity from all the points of view. The commercial exchanges with the CIS are decreasing continuously and now are even smaller than those with Romania, to talk about security makes no sense since the annexation of Crimea…</p>\r\n<p> for, e timpul să ne aducem aminte. Faptul că <a href=\"/ro/stiri/politic/513/Timofti-a-refuzat-s%C4%83-mearg%C4%83-la-Consiliul-%C8%99efilor-de-state-CSI-%E2%80%9EGreul%E2%80%9D-cade-pe-umerii-lui-Filip.htm\">ne mai ducem încolo</a> e o aberație din toate punctele de vedere. Schimburile comerciale cu țările din CSI sunt în scădere continuă și astăzi sunt deja mai mici decât cele cu România, de securitate nici nu mai are rost să discutăm de când cu anexarea Crimeii... What are we looking for there?! Meanwhile, our neighbor from the west, on which money were repaired our kindergartens, <a href=\"/ro/stiri/externe/480/Rom%C3%A2nia-consemneaz%C4%83-cea-mai-mare-cre%C8%99tere-economic%C4%83-din-UE-%C3%AEn-trimestrul-doi-din-2016.htm\">has the highest economic growth from across the EU</a>! Who has ears – hear it!</p>\r\n<p><strong>FROM THE ELECTORAL</strong><strong> </strong>Sincerely, I do not even know what to write about the election. Significantly, no? However, I got a thought: I do not see the difference between the parliamentary campaign and the present one... Or, to choose a party is not quite the same thing as choosing a President. I will mention just a few moments, telegraphic:</p>\r\n<p>Dodon is massively distributing <a href=\"/en/news/political/468/(PHOTO)-Dodon-found-his-%E2%80%9Eelectoral-enemy%E2%80%9D-In-the-campaign-he-will-fight-withthe-Romanian-gendarme.htm\">booklets with the “Romanian gendarme”</a>. He is afraid of DNA, I suppose…</p>\r\n<p>Voronin says that communists will boycott the elections. As few as they are, I do not think a difference is going to be noted.</p>\r\n<p>„Usatai” (quotes are necessary, because without them he doesn’t have the required years) says that will dissolve the Parliament. Well if he was not able, <a href=\"/ro/stiri/politic/371/Protestele-din-Moldova-Prezentul-%E2%80%9Erevolu%C8%9Bionar%E2%80%9D-la-bra%C5%A3-cu-trecutul-penal.htm\">with his bandits</a>, to take it by storm, even so, but he should know, and the voters that elementary, he <a href=\"/ro/stiri/politic/572/Victor-Pu%C5%9Fca%C5%9F-F%C4%83r%C4%83-avizul-CCM-dizolvarea-Parlamentului-ar-fi-o-%C3%AEnc%C4%83lcare-a-Constitu%C8%9Biei.htm\">has no right by the Constitution!</a></p>\r\n<p>DA-PAS-PLDM have not relinquished the idea to come up with a <a href=\"/ro/stiri/politic/465/Maia-Sandu-Candidatul-comun-va-fi-ales-%C3%AEn-baza-a-dou%C4%83-sondaje-interne.htm\">common candidate</a>. Attention, voters, you may sign for Sandu, however you will have to vote for Nastase. Or vice versa.</p>\r\n<p>Ghimpu and Chirtoaca continue both to be enchanting! The first one <a href=\"http://n4.md/emisiuni/16\">dreamed of Zina</a>, the second one – of Carla.</p>\r\n<p>As to the rest, exchanges of <a href=\"/en/news/political/477/Leanca-refreshes-Maia's-memory-She-chose-the-PD-PCRM-PLDM-alliance-though-she-knew-about-BEM-theft.htm\">astray rejoinders on facebook</a>…Lupu are not talking. He is the first one on the list. And nothing from nobody about the obligations of a President, about the country, about the citizens of the country…</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p><strong>AND THE PEOPLE, WHAT ARE DOING THE PEOPLE?</strong> <a href=\"/ro/stiri/social/472/VIDEO--FOTO--%C3%8En-doar-24-de-h-pompierii-au-stins-peste-80-de-incendii-de-vegeta%C8%9Bie.htm\">Burn down the country</a>…Literally.

                "lead": "I spent a lot of time thinking about a title for the editorial. Firstly, because it sounded too native Romanian, and just because the character I'm talking about today is a nobody that does not deserve any glance, let alone a huge editorial or any reply from the least important politician or representative of any serious institution fledged, on one or another side of the Prut.",
                "Continut": "<p>That is because we are talking about a random <em>citizen </em>of the Republic of Moldova, claiming to be Head of State with other 150.000 people, that remained in the Eastern occupied districts of the Republic of Moldova and, maybe, over 1500 Russian peacekeepers, who lead him. In addition, a <em>juggler,</em> because it is a very Romanian term for humbug, but one without stiffener - mediocre imitator of the classical joker at the fair, who got lost through other clowns, more schooled than he is.</p>\r\n<p>Ultimately, <em>forgetful</em>; because he made a start on anecdotes and memories, on the brink of the alleged \"presidential\" elections, invoked a voting with claims of a referendum, never sanctioned or recognized, from...10 years ago.</p>\r\n<p>In fact, the phantom and reality where can live such a persona, he an the ones forced to swallow his perception, is strange. The perception of a pseudo-state, pseudo-chief who, with his wife and the multitude of all sorts of girlfriends, think that laid hands on the separatist administration. As if in a building, with dozens of rooms, someone would decide it is a state, would put a flag and border and would call himself <em>President</em>. More than that he would make a semblance of the \"elections\". Also, when he wants to wipe the floor with all the improper logic, on which stands his existence, whence the self-determination clip and the need for independence, suddenly turns and backs off overnight to this \"independence\", never recognized by anyone and never experienced by any generation of residents from the space he abrogates, to change it on a union-integration with Russia...</p>\r\n<p>In fact, we have to deal with a farce under the guise of a qualified challenge, maybe come out some statements across Nistru. And even if it is across Prut, even better that such a stupidity is noticed. Because the issuance of a decree with the claim to apply a \"referendum\" - forgotten in 10 years and by those dragged to the polls by hunger and pushed with bayonets from the top of automatic weapons  - is nothing more than a trivial challenge. As there were the \"military exercises\" of anti-terrorist defense by forcing Dniester in the offensive to Chisinau. But even here was something meaty, which was showing that it is one army, the Russian one, coordinating the forces claiming to be regular troops, not paramilitary, of an unrecognized political entity.</p>\r\n<p>Thus, the electoral context, the joke with the remembrance about an alleged referendum from 10 years ago and the issuance of a decree of integration in Russia would be a nonsense and a bad joke, if weren't also dangerous. For the districts concerned, but also for the region. As you play with fire behind a Ukraine at war in Donbas and constantly provoked by the hyper-militarized Crimea is a suicidal undertaking which risks an enormous cost. The context in which Ukraine can always generate an excellent strategic-military solution, to sterilize the region that threatens Ukraine's back and frontally watches the conflict with Russia in Donbas.</p>\r\n<p>In the place of Shevchuk, I would walk on tiptoes, not clang the weapons in a parade and in the offensive military exercises. Or by pretending the unification with Russia, so Kiev could find a military enemy on the left side of Dniester.</p>\r\n<p>As to Chisinau and Bucharest, I would show maximum ignorance with these claims of being forgetful. Analysts, journalists, yes, they can react. At the limit, they may have a minimum pretended official reaction, to send the gesture ridiculously and, possibly, to reaffirm support for the sovereignty, territorial integrity and independence of the Republic of Moldova; but with particular attention on sudden military and challenging movements in the region.</p>\r\n<p>As for the discussions and debates about unilateral disposals of Chisinau and progresses at all costs of the 5+2 format, under the German presidency of the OSCE, I think the gestures of Shevchuk close any prospect of keeping the region on the agenda. Whether not here will be the next challenge of Russia.</p>",

More than that, the submission of the signed lists and documents has started. Also started the scandals and agitation of different candidates, an agitation of better positioning themselves.",
                "Continut": "<p>To start with, a first conclusion is that too many people announced that they want to be President. These plenitude reminds me of the 1990th Elections in Romania, first free elections, when a lot of people submitted their candidacy, more and more unserious. Because this plenitude of candidates without any chances, with no Party and without any kind of support and their nomination is only for future visit cards on which it will written with golden letters: <em>Candidate to Presidency of Republic of Moldova</em>,  is a prove of an incipient political culture, is an useless waste of money.</p>\r\n<p>In fact, the unserious candidates do not only create a crowding on the ballot paper – admitting that, at least partially, some of these nominees will submit the necessary documents to get on those ballot papers – but is crowding the public space with third – parties. Some might say that, although they intend, nevertheless, in some proportion to vote, it will be for the independent nominees. Nevertheless, the reality shows us that if there is no any political structure behind him and a representation at national level in the voting stations, only candidates that are truly sustained by big parties – in the impairment of their own nominees – could aim to a chance to obtain a reasonable percent at the polls.  </p>\r\n<p>There is the practice of false voters, of clones, of the companions and of the “greyhounds” that crowds the track only to impede the detachment of the platoon, in all the electoral races. May be. However, this tactics work, at polls in immature democratic countries. In USA, we have only 4 candidates, from which two of them are in the campaign only for pure reasons of decor and for encouragement of some ideas in the public space – the liberalism and the environmentalism. The big parties are still making the game. In Great Britain, UKIP vanished immediately after Brexit validation, not even assuming the governing of the United Kingdom after exiting EU, as requested, on the contrary, Nigel Farange left home. In Spain, Ciudadamos extended the Governmental crises for the second time after the repeated elections, because he does not want to associate with classical parties, proving it is an anti-system and unreasonable Party, which does not take responsibility of governing. At Bucharest, the Save Bucharest Union took the local votes from the PNL dowry, with anarchism from the left wing with votes from the right wing, but did not took responsibility for city’s administration.</p>\r\n<p>In Moldova the situation seems to be as well confusing, from many candidates of different colors, but the voter does not seem to be attracted by this race. Moreover, this context raises issues for those with reduced notoriety and debatable visibility. This could be a reason for the multitude of candidates; transparency of anybody is not relevant in Moldova until today. Maybe that is the reason of running after identity and agitation of some competitors.</p>\r\n<p>The biggest mistake of a candidate at a poll is to challenge the poll itself. The lists of voters, organization, registration. Any beginner political consultant, any second year student at political sciences and any student at the political communication, even a freshman, knows it. You cannot claim winning a race that you enrolled in, if you start by motivating the subsequent loss at the voting through contesting the rules of the game.</p>\r\n<p>Do not understand me incorrectly: technical issues are very important and can present the difference between victory and defeat. However, you do not identify publicly like this as a candidate and do not become credible as a winner, do not attract votes, whether it is the public approach of the campaign.</p>\r\n<p>The accusation of theft at the urns belongs to the helpless ones, but even those are playing it at the end of the campaign. The President of the Romania Mare Party and eternal nominee, Corneliu Vladimir Tudor, had the habit to claim even after the end of elections that the surveys were wrong, the results should make him a winner, but the win was stolen from him. However, he also was marking the game of the winner, he appeared everywhere as the one who dominated the race and surely would win, nor as a looser, but the theft references were at the final, eventually after the results of voting.</p>\r\n<p>The campaign started here as well with a same scandal. Andrei Nastase, the DA Party nominee, started by contesting the rules of the game and registration of Marian Lupu on a Saturday, first on the list, so first on the ballot paper. Besides, of the vagueness regarding the rules of drawing lots of the place on the ballot paper, after the final registration of all candidates, starting the campaign with such accusations is not the way of a winner, but a qualified looser. A winner does not care about the place on the ballot paper; his supporters will find his name. On the contrary, the scandal for minor technical affairs shows lack of preoccupation for serious matters in the campaign and for its own posture at the elections.    </p>\r\n<p>We may consider that the attack was just a positioning as an opponent of Marian Lupu, PDM candidate, and as a player in the image plane by agitation, noise, increased visibility from the first moment. If this was the strategy, the theme was missed, as the chosen opponent. I do not think Marian Lupu has a chance to qualify to the second round if the right pro-European opposition will go on with a single candidate and if all spokespersons, including Nastase and PDA support him consistently. Therefore, the chosen opponent does not help, on the contrary. Moreover, in the second round, a candidate that cannot bring the votes of his pro-European supporters cannot win the nominee from the left wing, admitting that he will accede in the second round. That is why I say that Andrei Nastase manifests himself as a short-tempered and agitated ordinary outsider, announcing anticipated, at subliminal level, his loss to all his supporters. Let us hope that at second thought he will support the better-placed candidate of the right wing, according to the agreement.</p>",

What is written in the law referring to the calendars or rules of the game really does not matter. Nor has ever mattered, frankly speaking. Use of public resources or lack of financial transparency are undoubtedly quarter-secular traditions and mysteries in the Republic of Moldova. I would not want to spoil the mood and enthusiasm of those who give themselves up today to uncover the <a href=\"/ro/stiri/politic/789/Promo-LEX-bate-alarma-despre-mi%C8%99ma%C8%99urile-concuren%C8%9Bilor-la-prezentarea-rapoartelor-financiare.htm\" target=\"_blank\">violations of the \"protocol\"</a> (I assure you it is a necessary exercise and rather ungrateful) but I insist that this plague is not an endemic one. However elsewhere, they are typically somehow hidden, even from the world, while here a Dodon, for example, distributes bumph with \"Romanian gendarme\" freely. And try to do something to a candidate credited by <a href=\"/en/news/political/785/Survey--The-first-five-favored-candidates-at-presidential-elections.htm\" target=\"_blank\">a survey</a> with over 36% of voting intentions?!</p>\r\n<p>However, we will return to the troublesome later. I have the possibility to start this edition with something really good! </p>\r\n<p><strong>DRAMA! MORE DRAMA IN CHISINAU!</strong> Until September 21<sup>st</sup>, Chisinau is the <a href=\"/ro/stiri/cultura/633/Iubitorii-de-teatru-invita%C5%A3i-la-cea-de-a-doua-edi%C5%A3ie-a-%E2%80%9EReuniunii-Teatrelor-Na%C8%9Bionale-la-Chi%C5%9Fin%C4%83u%E2%80%9D.htm\" target=\"_blank\">capital of the Romanian drama</a>! The Romanian Cultural Institute brings to Chisinau the national theaters from all over the Country! Sibiu, Craiova, Iasi, Bucharest, Cluj-Napoca, Chisinau (2), Balti, Cahul - a geography and a program more than impressive! Really, dear residents of Chisinau, you are enviable!</p>\r\n<p><strong>THE UNION (FOR NOW, ONLY ON TV)</strong> I cannot overlook the <a href=\"http://moldnova.eu/ro/unionistii-si-au-lansat-televiziune-la-chisinau-unirea-tv-este-un-proiect-al-poporului-6082.html/\" target=\"_blank\">appearance of a new TV station</a>, \"Unirea TV\"! They are still at the early stage and there is much work (I would advise you to change the logo, for example, I think it is naive and unprofessional), but for a TV station who collected money from around the world to launch, it's a good start. It's a little, not enough, however it is a drop, which is diluting even more the ocean of the ever-present Putin's propaganda in our country...</p>\r\n<p><strong>ROMANIA TAKES CARE OF OUR CHILDREN </strong>The Government of Romania <a href=\"/en/news/social_en/584/Romania's-Government-will-continue-to-fund-the-construction-and-renovation-of-Moldovan-kindergartens.htm\" target=\"_blank\">will continue to fund the kindergartens</a> in Moldova! For two years, it has allocated 23 million euros to repair and remodel 832 kindergartens in ALL the districts of the country. Only, if we believe the participants in the<a href=\"https://www.privesc.eu/arhiva/68841/Emisiunea--Sfatul-Tarii---cu-Constantin-Codreanu\" target=\"_blank\"> program \"Sfatul Tarii\" (Unirea TV)</a>, this thing is not known by the citizens of ALL the localities where Romanian money have been invested. In other words, the mayors from Romanophobe parties make a political capital on Romanian money. Perhaps something went bad on the communication level. Perhaps those who had to deal with communication, instead were on the bum. Too bad ...</p>\r\n<p><strong></strong>In this way, slowly, we passed from the good stuff to the crazy one...</p>\r\n<p><strong>THE UNCLASSIFIED PROTOCOL </strong>the Prime-Minister Pavel Filip published shorthand report (violating probably the law, because it was classified \"secret folder\") of the Government meeting when it was decided the allocation of the emergency credit for BEM. Apparently Maia Sandu has to gain from this, because she was the only one who tried to speak against this. But in the end she voted as well. Enough was said about this document. Some commended Maia Sandu. others attacked her for signing the document. That's how happened with every protagonist of the shorthand report... Some calculated and realized that the amount of the credit does not does not match the total of deposits that supposedly needed to be guaranteed... I advise you to read the shorthand report and try to put yourself in the place of any Minister from that cabinet. So there comes a guy in the Government (let him be Dragutanu and he says, all of a sudden: \"People, this is bad. We are screwed. If you don't give money, a lot of money, we will go up with a bang\") Which was the reaction that seemed to right? No, not answers brought by Maia Sandu: \"And must I vote this crap?\" (she eventually voted in the end, I mean she made all that theater for nothing, maybe only for that shorthand report, who knows?) If I was a Minister, I would say that I can not vote cause of the lack of information. Not that I am against or in favor, but naturally, I can not vote. I would demand from Dragutanu a much more detailed report over situation, instead of what we are reading in the shorthand report. After all, not all the bankers can understand from a couple of phrases what is happening, and you can not vote like that, in rush, such cosmic amounts of money! But NO ONE, I repeat, NO ONE had an proper reaction. But this is only my opinion of course. I think that this document would deserve a much greater attention and much more serious discussions in mass-media, but... the event was outshined by a typical electoral \"compromising material\"...         </p>\r\n<p><strong>CHIRTOACA IGITUR </strong>On internet was postet a video in which<a href=\"/ro/stiri/politic/668/Arhiv%C4%83-compromi%C8%9B%C4%83toare-Chirtoac%C4%83-filmat-la-un-chef-%C3%AEn-garaj-cu-vodc%C4%83-bere-%C8%99i-%E2%80%9ELiub%C4%83%E2%80%9D.htm\" target=\"_blank\"> Chirtoaca is having a party in the garage</a>, with alcohol and singing Russian military song. On this matter you can think anything, we all know that thing like private life, that he is also a human, that there is no accounting for tastes, let the one who never was wrong to throw the first rock, the politics is a bitch and so on. All good and true... like in the Filat case, the problem is not about the film, who made it, who posted and why (although this is an interesting thing). The problem is that this film exists. Look, I know a lot of people, some even really high-positioned ones, that do not have this kinds of films. And that could not have one. Because if you do not know how to stay sober, you must know how, and with whom to drink. That’s it.</p>\r\n<p><strong>GAUDEAMUS DORINEL </strong>Immediately after the posting of the film with Chirtoaca screaming a Lyube's song, in the public space appeared another document which said that <a href=\"/ro/stiri/social/690/(DOC)-Prim%C4%83ria-municipiului-Chi%C8%99in%C4%83u-a-aprobat-demolarea-cinematografului-Gaudeamus.htm\" target=\"_blank\">the Gaudeamus theatre will be demolished</a>. There were possible more discussions, inclusively about cultural spaces, about the owner and the proprietary right and even the architectural value of the building, if Chirtoaca would not stated that he is flogging a dead horse... But after I saw what is going to be built on that site, i join with those who are defending the theater <em>corps et âme</em>. The fact that Chirtoaca is loosing it while is making a mull out of something should not surprise us anymore. Dorinel should thank his uncle. And there is something more, maybe a good communication adviser could help him. Again Communication.... Again some guys that are on the bum...          </p>\r\n<p><strong>ARE THE RUSSIANS INSPECTING US?! </strong>They are saying that a commission from Rosselhoznadzor (you can twist your tongue with this name!) is coming <a href=\"https://point.md/ru/novosti/ekonomika/eksperti-rosseljhoznadzora-proinspektiruyut-sadi-moldovi\" target=\"_blank\">to inspect our melon-fields</a>... I don't know how others are looking at this, but I consider this is humiliating. What commissions? What inspections? Could we have some pride? I am not speaking about \"national pride\" and things that have no bases, but about elementary pride. After all, let us leave this overweening emotions apart and think rationally. 64% from our exports <a href=\"/en/news/business/776/Moldova%E2%80%99s-exports-to-EU-at-about-64-of-total-exports.htm\" target=\"_blank\">are already going towards EU markets</a>. So let the rest also to go and not to get blackmailed by those when and how they want!</p>\r\n<p><strong>CANTARIAN AT SHEVCHUK </strong>The lord Vladimir is blessing Shevchuk, who, no long ago <a href=\"/ro/stiri/politic/578/Biroul-de-reintegrare-Calific%C4%83m-decretul-lui-%C5%9Eevciuk-drept-unul-nul-%C5%9Fi-neavenit.htm\" target=\"_blank\">signed some decrees</a> through which he would want the \"reunification\" with Russia. Although I ask myself to what extent this actions, as well as Dodon's, Usatai, Nastase and so on, who more than once instigated to hate, to violent overturn of the \"regime\", or even tried to subversion it, can be sanctioned by law. Maybe they should inspire from Russians? They sanction any \"separatist\" instigation... even if, paradox? they organize <a href=\"https://tvrain.ru/articles/bobby_sands-394655\" target=\"_blank\">the separatist Congress from all over the world</a> at Moscow, financed directly from Putin's money. Or maybe we should ask our negotiating \"partners\", if we should still give them licence plates? By the way, Shevchuk was not invited to Moscow.      </p>\r\n<p>This is it... I was thinking to tell you something about the electoral campaign... I changed my mind. I don't want to. Cause you will not say that your choice will depend on what is happening or will happen in the days to come?</p>",

                "lead": "The electoral campaign was launched in the Republic of Moldova, even though the echoes are seen, especially, on the margins and in the central mass media and lesser in the territory. However, we are at the beginning of the presidential elections, which highlights certain problems of fairness and way of candidates' presentation: firstly, a relatively late date when is decided the validation of the candidates and the enrollment on the ballot, therefore the absence of the rule of casting lots of the positions on the ballot paper.",
                "Continut": "<p>The biggest unknown thing is how many from those 25 candidates who announced the registration on the lists will succeed at collecting the needed signatures for the enlistment on the ballot and how many will respect the rules on the financing in order to avoid the elimination from the voting in the end? A case in point exists, since 2014, with \"Our Party\", so the technical and judicial component of the enrollment and organization of the electoral race are the most important in order to avoid the final elimination, and those presented in a complicated image referring to the credibility of the poll, as we have already seen.</p>\r\n<p>However maybe the most important stake for the vote from October 30 and for the chances to become president in the second round is represented by the candidates that can enter this turn. Igor Dodon seems to be the favorite, but he shall avoid controversies and create space to attract also other votes. Dmitri Ciubasenko has a problem with absorbing the transfer made by the Party and Renato Usatai, a good performance would guarantee him the enrollment in second round, in the case that the rules which can lead to disqualification are respected. </p>\r\n<p>Therefore, maybe the most important point is a candidate from the pro-European right-wing in the second round and the winner of the voting, respectively the extent of the joint statement to support a common candidate and, specifically his real support in the campaign by all the right-wing parties with all the forces after choosing the nominee with most chances to attract also the votes of the pro-Europeans in power at the second round of the poll.</p>\r\n<p>The last public appearance of Andrei Nastase where he reaffirms the support of the single candidate is greeted. Such a posture is obligating him to keep his word; if no, he risks to take part with Iurie Leanca, the other \"deserter\" of the right-wing, a candidate that already is between chairs and has few chances of visibility except some photos with external persons. Whether he makes a last moment move, and also, with his party, standing for the common candidate, after the withdrawal from the race close to its ending. On the other hand, the uncertainty regarding the final decision is alarming, consequently the attempt to prolong the excitement. </p>\r\n<p>In principle, the agreement for the single candidate of the right-wing makes sense to the extent that the selection is done quicker and in a more consolidated way. If the deadline of enlistment on the ballot expires, or if, for whatever reason, there are several candidates on the ballot, even if they retreated and announced support for a third party, there is a great chance that votes are wasted. Communication capacity is low enough and people's options - insufficiently channeled to the useful vote, that the waste of valuable votes is great, in the case there are more candidates on ballot papers.</p>\r\n<p>It is true that several candidates - <em>accompanying </em>the race - create the opportunity to multiply the targets for opponents, allow an easier launch of diversions and scenarios for the role play of different partners. Nevertheless, this game has to stop before structuring the ballot. The clarity and work in the territory will be decisive. In addition, here will be played the chance of the pro-Europeans to possess the presidency of the Republic of Moldova and to maintain the pro-Western orientation of the country.</p>\r\n<p>Let us assume that this is not done, that exists a belated support of the common candidate or does not exist at all this support. Maintaining two candidates from the right-wing in the race, whatever are the results of the surveys, will determine the move of the weight of the actual decision on a third party, PLDM, the one that does not have a candidate in the race. And here will take place, actually, another important point of the voting, when the burden of the decision falls back on Viorel Cibotaru, the president of PLDM. Obviously, the chances of the candidate decrease even more, as now the chances are lower than if there was a candidate outside the political spectrum, elected earlier and supported clearly by that initial four parties, participating at the negotiation: evidence of altruism, solidarity, rationality and pragmatism of the pro-European right-wing.</p>\r\n<p>Somehow, the candidate chosen by PLDM, on the basis of the opinion poll, would be the one to mobilize the reliable, hopeful, emotional side of the right-wing electorate, moving the looser in the irrelevant zone of traitors and guilty ones for the big fiasco of the poll won by Igor Dodon or, even worse, for the absence of the right-wing nominee in the second round.</p>\r\n<p>It is an interesting voting, especially, in point of perspective of the political parties and candidates of the pro-European right-wing also after the voting, beyond the strategical relevance of maintaining the pro-European vector. As an observer, I will look from the exterior, from the orchestra box as an connoisseur of the backstage games and experience in such kind of voting. Surely, not uninvolved, meaning that I will support undoubtedly the pro-Western, pro-European orientation and I will not bother telling and arguing that the election of Igor Dodon will bring instability and major turmoil in Chisinau after the elections.</p>",

Once you are in her good graces, you are doomed to success. The mass adores you. You live the feeling that you have the world at your feet.  Meanwhile, madam Legitimacy is fickle. She is not spending a lot of time with the same chevalier. In order to have her beside, you shall demonstrate, permanently, that you are the best one and you deserve her. She is coquette, proud and, sometimes, even arrogant, our lady. She does not accept half measures.",
                "Continut": "<p>Legitimacy means love, but not a blind one. She does not tolerate lies, hypocrisy and betrayal. At one time, when you do not expect, nor want, you can become invisible. To win her sympathy, you shall put unimaginable efforts, but it can all dissipate very quickly. A word said out of time, a fact that came out bothers her a lot. Suffers. Then she forgets you. And you become invisible. That is different from being invisible. You are no longer credible. Little chances you will recover. Practically, none.</p>\r\n<p>In politics, the legitimacy justifies the power. The history of mankind, in the stages of its political development, has experienced various factors that ensured the legitimacy of the political power. In Max Weber's classification, they are reduced, synthetically, at three forms of political legitimacy: traditional, charismatic and rational-legal. Modernity, without excluding the first two forms, emphasizes rationality and legality in legitimizing political power, which in turn serves as the foundation for a democratic, stable and durable government.</p>\r\n<p>A first condition for a power to be legitimate is to be legal, namely to be established strictly according to the law. Compliance with this principle makes the winner to assume the right to govern and the governed ones to recognize this right. In fact, it is one of the fundamental principles of democracy and part of what we call the rule of law.</p>\r\n<div>In the Republic of Moldova, since the first elections, has already become a tradition, some kind of national sport, that the looser would contest the election's result. Usually, the declaration of vote rigging is accompanied by different charges: falsification of voter's lists, wrong ballot counting, bribing the voters etc. Let us remember that the falsification of election's results was one of the main excuses that launched the events from April 7, 2009. The reasons of this situation can be different: from the mistrust in justice till the traits of the political culture of the citizens. Each time, however, our enthusiasm was limited to accusations, without the toil on proving. Even more strange, after all is consumed, there are some \"heroes\" for civic righteousness, accusations of fraud, even on the field which they were responsible for.</div>\r\n<p>We are on the brink of a new electoral campaign. This time a presidential one. In the context of a very uptight political situation, it is important that the electoral exercise will take place in a strict accordance with the legal norms. Both the letter and the spirit of the law to be respected at all the stages, beginning with the structuring of the electoral lists and finishing with the process of counting the votes. In reality, however, watching the ardors of collecting the signatures and registering the candidates for the elections from October 30, 2016, we conclude a tension without a case in point of the political situation, a harsh shuddering between the protagonists of the campaign. Behind them are cohorts of employees, who are very attentive at the speck that is in his opponent's eye, but do not notice the log that is in his own eye.</p>\r\n<p>Mutual distrust between the candidates at the elections makes the electoral debate to slip from the competition of the projects and ideas, obviously, towards a fair of vanities and intolerance. If you sit and analyze, you realize that, in fact, the stake is not that big. The position of the president, in a parliamentary republic, does not offer too much power to the Head of State. In addition, the precarious situation in which the country is, should calm down the appetites of the people wishing important posts. Here, we have probably to deal with reasons beyond the candidates, the stakes are transferring to the people from the backstage politics. We find that this backstage is often outside of the country. Some candidates do not hesitate to hide the fact that come to destroy more than to create. </p>\r\n<p>It is known: within the reach of the government are more leverages to use the administrative resources for campaign purposes, from setting the election date until the use of camouflaged electoral advertising by creating events and their coverage. This happens, practically, in all the societies, even those with functioning democracy. In fact, in the interest of the government is that the elections take place without major excesses, so they should give as few as possible excuses for complaints. On the other hand, intolerant opposition representatives have already rushed to turn to external partners with statements that the elections are going to be bilked. Somehow, they laid something: in case of a failure, to fall on something soft. However, it goes on a maximum tension of the situation, which may culminate in post-election agony.</p>\r\n<p>That is why, the responsibility of a correct deployment of the elections falls both on the shoulders of the government and the electoral institutions responsible for the organization and a good progress of the electoral process, and on the opposition shoulders, always ready to provoke conflict and tension situations for minor infringements. A word to say have the institutions of the civil society, called to watch and monitor the electoral process.</p>\r\n<p>All those who want a smooth running of the businesses in the country, should take care of restoring the citizen's confidence in the state institutions and, linked to this, in the political class. The legitimacy is based on competence and real facts, not empty words and handling. The implementation of the Association Agreement will give less and less room for maneuver for all those who aspire to enrich personal power. Further will be tougher. Romania's example is eloquent. We hope it will not be too long and among politicians on the bank of Bac river will be completed only by those for whom politics is a vocation and a profession, a saying of the same Weber.</p>",

                "Continut": "<p>A whole apparatus of thinkers and idea creators are trying to identify the possibility to relaunch and reenergize the European project. Really, the European Union gathered overlapped crises, from the default in Greece, sovereign debt crisis across Europe, followed by the waves of immigrants, the terrorist attacks, radicalization and recruitment of unintegrated groups of  French, Belgian, German, British nationals of second and third generation , who came from the colonies, their recruitment, then the foreign fighters for the theaters of terrorist operations and the lack of cohesion of Europe, until Brexit, the lack of leadership, lack of trust of the European citizen and hope in the European project. A long list and, to a great extent, an exasperating one!</p>\r\n<p>The European leaders – heads of state and government – gathered in Bratislava, the capital of the holder of the half-yearly rotating EU presidency to discuss the formulas to rescue Europe. Right from the beginning, the speeches were not at all encouraging, but, on the contrary, deeply skeptical and catastrophic on the capacity to solve the European problems. The European Union is in a crisis, announced the German Chancellor Angela Merkel. Yes, the European Union might fail, stated also the president of the European Parliament, Martin Schultz. The meeting ended with the decision of the Member States to take the European project and create a roadmap until March 2017, on the celebration of the 60th anniversary of the Treaty of Rome, which launched the European communities, by addressing solutions to all the topics of concern of the European citizens.</p>\r\n<p>Far from being a panacea, they are still trying to find solutions, the summit from Bratislava launched an interesting and worth watching process. Hereinafter, the service doubters, just out of the meeting, disputed without a stop the community solutions. Whether the prolongation of the sanctions on Russia, as a result of the military aggression in eastern Ukraine, have not aroused discussions this time, Viktor Orban remained deeply dissatisfied about the continuity of solutions on refugees’ issue, dissatisfaction joined also by the Polish president Yaroslav Kaczinski. As to the rest, the good intentions were not necessarily doubled by convincing solutions, although at the level of the summit, the communication of European policies was a subject.</p>\r\n<p>However, we must not look too far, there is no even need to invent new integrational projects, which will pass on the idea of continuity and deepening the integration during the European project – see the controversy regarding the European Army. The assumption of the European project stays a big issue, at the national leaders’ level, with populists’ visions, nationalist visions or shady alliances with extremist and Eurosceptic parties at the Government. Nevertheless, the easiest solution remains to be the <em>expansion politics of EU</em>. In addition, at the West of Balkans level the reform stagnation is chronic, emphasizing new political crisis, the address to expansion in the contiguous space is the priority number one.</p>\r\n<p>The Republic of Moldova and Ukraine are countries were the extinction comes naturally. In Chisinau’s case, re-launching the reforms is obvious, undisputed already at the international level. In the Ukraine’s case, a special situation combines, the pragmatic composition – defending Europe and its values by Kiev – the relevant market, the payment through loans to support the war effort, at the same time with reforms, that involves also EU states, but especially, the moral duty that Ukraine lost a part of its territory and it is at war with Russia in its Eastern regions, because chose the EU integration and for signing the Free Trade Agreement. Moreover, we will not talk about the 1994<sup>th</sup> Memorandum in Budapest, signed at the giving up of the nuclear weapons from its territory in exchange for security guarantee, where the Western countries could not keep their part of the deal and present the offered guarantees.      </p>\r\n<p>In both cases, the Europeans can make this effort, which is less expensive than EU is taking already by supporting the sanctions towards Russia or financially supporting Kiev, including through reform consultancy. Furthermore, 1% from the European funds of the member states would count for 30 billion euros, which could support Ukraine, are equivalent of less than 10% of the amount of money invested in saving Greece form the collapse (and the bill is not paid yet.</p>\r\n<p>As for the separatism and occupied territories, in both cases – the Republic of Moldova and Ukraine – as in the Georgia’s case, which also needs, urgently, visas liberalization – I must say that in special cases, special measures are assigned; and EU learned already to manage Cyprus. A small effort for the most successful European politics, which brings profits to the member states, as well as to new future members, validates the transformation force of the EU, the capacity to go further and the will to ensure the fact that a veto right of an actor from the outside of the Union towards EU politics is not allowed and the sovereign decision of the aspiring states. A minimum effort, an acceptable discomfort and easily absorbed for a political gesture and substance visionary.</p>",

                "lead": "Long ago, when I was a child, my parents had a sovietic washing machine (in fact, back there everything was sovietic). It was called OKA. It was the most simple prehistorical peace of junk: an electrical relay, a motor, timing belt and an aluminium barrel that was spinning on a disc - that's it! My mother use to say: \"I am going to spin the laundry\", not to wash them. (Here is the first similarity: do we not say \"to spin the money\"?). When I grow up I was mobilized to dry clothes....",
                "Continut": "<p>After when my folks bought <a href=\"http://www.vitalie-vovc.com/2016/03/Si-aceasta-tara-centrifuga-a-mea.html\">a centrifuge</a>, I was free of spinning the laundry. And is seemed that there was nothing that could brake that monster,but at least three of four times a year, it would happen. Then my father was turning her upside down and took the aggregate apart... When the engine was burning, when the electrical relay, when the timing belt... and we would be happy to get rid of her, but... there were no other machines. You can not imagine what a release felt my mother when she got a new automatic washing machine!!! Why am I telling you all this? Last week the \"Moldovan laundromat\" broke! I hope that no one can repair it... </p>\r\n<p>But about the ugly stuff - later. Let us start with something beautiful, because we have it!</p>\r\n<p><strong>JAZZ – JAZZ – JAZZ</strong> At Chisinau, - I was telling you last week that you, Chisinau citizens, are lucky! - from 15 till 18 of September took place <a href=\"/ro/stiri/cultura/826/A-%C3%AEnceput-Festivalul-Ethno-Jazz-edi%C5%A3ia-a-XV-a.htm\" target=\"_blank\">the International Ethno Jazz Festival</a>. Music of the highest quality with bands from 14 countries: Austria, Brasil, Bulgaria, Cuba, Switzerland, France, Germany, Italy, Mongolia, Poland, Serbia, USA and the Republic of Moldova! Anatol Stefanet, the \"father\" of the festival (and of the \"Trigon\" band) allied us with good people and keeps us there for many years. We should be grateful for this, to purchase a disc ones in a while, to buy a ticket to the concert. I assure you: the artist do not live only from the applause!  </p>\r\n<p><strong>OUR DAILY HEROES </strong>Last week I was writing you about the vegetation fires in Moldova. The firefighters had a Hot Autumn start. All last week, the Romanian SMURD had <a href=\"/ro/stiri/social/847/Ajutor-aero-medical-SMURD-pentru-un-minor-de-trei-ani.htm\" target=\"_blank\">interventions in Moldova</a> to help a three year old child. I promised myself to write more often about this people when happened the tragedy with SMURD, because it is unfair that we remember them only when is too late... </p>\r\n<p><strong>THE AMERICANS ARE HELPING US</strong> They said that they will double the aids for Moldova. You know, them, the Ambassador of those who in August was committing a Lese-Romanian sin. Who can understand those Anglo-Saxons?</p>\r\n<p>That is all with the beautiful things. Although what is coming next is not bad at all, but I do not want neither to call it \"beautiful\":</p>\r\n<p>Cam atât la capitolul evenimentelor frumoase. Deși ceea ce va urmă nu-i rău deloc, dar nici nu-mi vine a-i zice „frumos”:</p>\r\n<p><strong>THE LAUNDROMAT BROKE! </strong><a href=\"/en/news/social_en/958/EXCLUSIVE--The-list-of-judges-detained-by-the-anti-corruption-prosecutors-A-magistrate-caught-in-the-Aeroport.htm\" target=\"_blank\">Unprecedented arrests</a> in the Republic of Moldova! 20 officials of the judiciary system, key elements of the so called \"Moldovan Laundromat\" through which was laundered 20 billions dollars, were arrested! The prosecutors are saying that are more to come. How was saying our friend Ostap? <em>\"The ice was broken, ladies and gentlemen of the jury!\"</em> Now I would like one more thing: <a href=\"/en/news/social_en/997/The-prosecutors-presented-the-scheme-of-USD-milliards-laundering-from-the-corrupt-judges'-file.htm\" target=\"_blank\">In those schemes were occurred</a> some companies from Great Britain. So, gentlemen who are teaching us lessons of virtue and legitimacy, maybe you could show us an example of how you fight with the international banditry. I do understand that in out country is stealing from us, but those money are going somewhere?</p>\r\n<p><strong>\"ELECTIONS\" IN RUSSIA </strong>Therefore, <a href=\"/en/news/international/896/Putin's-party-wins-the-elections-in-the-State-Duma-How-looks-the-Russian-parliament's-structure.htm\" target=\"_blank\">Putin proved that he subdued Russia</a> once and for all. It is know how end the leaders that have a 87% rating. But I want to tell you something else: The internet was invaded by videos at the Russian polling stations where the employees were filling the urns with ballot papers. With all this, the presence at the vote was very low: only 47,81%... For now, I will say only this: as big is the absenteeism, it is more easy to forge the elections. We are not Russia. And yet... I will come back to this subject. When we will be closer to the election date. For now, I recommend you <a href=\"/ro/stiri/opinii/937/Alexandru-T%C4%83nase-despre-alegerile-din-Rusia-%C5%9Fi-viitorul-scrutin-preziden%C8%9Bial-din-Moldova.htm\">the text of Alexandru Tanase</a>, with which I totally agree: <em>\"It is said very rarely about the responsibility of the citizens about the state of our society, although some citizens are those who through their passivity lead to power poor leaders, are creating constitutional majorities and are installing a kleptocracy Government. Unfortunately the citizens do not realize that there are no elections without any bets. Truthfully the things can be influenced, the important thing is that in the day you have the possibility to perform this influence and not to stay at home\"</em>.     </p>\r\n<p><strong>THE EMIGRANTS WANT TO VOTE!</strong> Multiple organisations and personalities that emigrated launched <a href=\"http://www.vitalie-vovc.com/2016/09/chisinaul-nu-mai-are-nevoie-de-voturile-emigratilor.html\" target=\"_blank\">an appeal to the Authorities from the Republic of Moldova</a> demanding the possibility to vote in the same conditions as in the 2014: polling stations and the possibility to vote with expired passports. Even if the representative of the Promo-LEX NGO, which should defend the democratic values, according to the personal status, confirms that Moldova 1 and the signatories of the open letter are lying (it is true that they apologized later for the error. On Facebook, and the accusations was made at the TV post Moldova 1, as they say - feel the difference), i this way it has been voted in 2014, in 2010 and in 2009. I do not see why now it should be different. We will wait for the CEC's press releases. Let us hope that the reason will triumph.     </p>\r\n<p><strong>MOLDOVA DOES NOT WANT CIS. ONLY THE PRESIDENCY DOES NOT WANT IT </strong>At the CIS Summit <a href=\"/ro/stiri/politic/820/Secretarul-General-explic%C4%83-de-ce-Republica-Moldova-a-refuzat-pre%C5%9Fedin%C5%A3ia-CSI.htm\" target=\"_blank\">Moldova refused</a> to take over the Presidency of CIS. So what? The Presidency passed to Russia. Moldova did not quit CIS.

Others waited for him quietly. This is order in this organisation. </p>\r\n<p>That's it.

Dodon is so poor, that his parents are helping him to survive, and some mysterious rotten societies from the <a href=\"/ro/stiri/politic/1034/RISE-Sediul-PSRM-%C3%AEn-proprietatea-unor-companii-offshore-implicate-%C3%AEn-scandalul-Panama-Papers.htm\" target=\"_blank\">capitalist off-shore</a> are forcing him to keep his headquarters in one of their buildings. </p>\r\n<p>- Usatai is <a href=\"/ro/stiri/social/985/Usat%C3%AEi-se-pl%C3%A2nge-c%C4%83-i-urm%C4%83rit-penal-la-B%C4%83l%C8%9Bi.htm\" target=\"_blank\">criminal persecuted</a> at Balti, and <a href=\"/ro/stiri/social/986/(FOTO)-Ofi%C5%A3er-MAI---fiu-de-ex-deputat-re%C5%A3inut-pentru-proxenetism-%C3%8El-va-ferici-%C8%99tirea-pe-RUsat%C3%AEi.htm\" target=\"_blank\">his pals</a> - arrested for pandering and drug traffic. That is how is it in a \"captive state\".

It is a rotten asset. He does not want it any more.

This due to the chance to entail new voters in the second round, to attract as much as possible support from the voters of the pro-European vector, and last but not least, to avoid discreditable compromises is a necessary condition for the victory in the presidential elections. In addition, this studies can be found at the qualitative level of the sociological research, not in a quantitative study, I repeat, like a survey of public attitudes. Thankfully, my evaluation is that both studies would designate the same candidate - the one preferred by PLDM.</p>\r\n<p>Firstly, the project started with 4 parties: PLDM, PPEM, PAS, PDA. However, from the beginning, Iurie Leanca or tried to steal the start, or to consider that he is special, by sending deputies, to replace him, at those reunions; so as, later, when he considered that he has no chance, to pass to the formula \"between the camps\": neither fish, nor fowl; both in power and in opposition, betraying, actually, the project. He did not sign anything, was not present at the meetings (leaving for 4 trips abroad), hence he benefits of some motives and excuses for the obvious accusation of betrayal. Then, Leanca glided to exceptionalism, tried to be recognized internationally, even posting a photo with Angela Merkel. A drop in the bucket, in front of the electorate too absorbed in the real problems, to pay attention to the subtle meaning, almost imperceptible, and whom the photos from the personal archive, which do not guarantee and do not say, basically, anything, left him cold.</p>\r\n<p>I will stop here, of good fellowship. I know the one who makes his campaign, he is a good friend of mine and, from professional courtesy, I will ignore Leanca entirely in this campaign, because he is a marginal character in this race, who does not deserve attention. He could have done more to help the project of the single candidate, if he did not look that much in the mirror, saying, narcissistic: \"Oh, how proud I am!\"...</p>\r\n<p>Then the game summed up to those three, PLDM (without a direct candidate), PAS and PPDA. Those three parties, with already changed chances of the single nominee project of the right-wing, after the disappearance of PPEM from the equation, signed a common statement (not an agreement!), which involves the withdrawal of one of the two candidates in the race at the start of the campaign. I have already said that the measure comes too late, when both names will be on the ballot and that will lead to the waste of the already reduced dowry of these votes.</p>\r\n<p>At this point came between the break, practically obvious, even if untold: after posting the photo of Iurie Leanca next to the Chancellor Angela Merkel, with the supposed direct support that results from the communique of PPEM, Viorel Cibotaru wanted to compensate the situation, pointing out that PLDM is a member of the European people's family, not the party with the name European People's Party of Moldova that belongs to Leanca, so he arranged a meeting with Joseph Daul, EPP President, that marked the explicit support of a single candidate. However out of that two possible candidates, Cibotaru introduced only Maia Sandu, placed as the second in all the surveys so far, but \"agreed by most members of the PLDM.\" However, Viorel Cibotaru, the PLDM president, and Maia Sandu reaffirmed that remain firmly engaged in the common declaration: that of establishing a single candidate based on surveys until October 1.</p>\r\n<p>Andrei Nastase also marked a lateral step. Found on the third place in surveys (not approved for tie breaker) and without benefiting from the treatement offered by the EPP president, the leader of PDA,  hinted a possible exit from the game. He seems not to be accepting anymore the agreement of withdrawal from the race based on the results of the surveys. Nastase started to push a fatidic formula and without any relative content for the \"national interest\" as the supreme motivation, aside from what the opinion polls are showing, in order to launch his own candidature. Result? Even less chances of the right-wing candidate to enroll in the second round, plus the possibility of a severe confrontation for the same electorate and, implicitly, the increase of the PLDM support significance for Maia Sandu. </p>\r\n<p> pentru lansarea propriei candidaturi. Rezultatul? Șanse și mai mici ale candidatului dreptei de a intra în turul doi, plus posibilitatea unei confruntări acute pentru același electorat și, implicit, creșterea semnificației sprijinului PLDM pentru Maia Sandu. The fact that seems to clearly determine the decision for the future presidential candidate of the united right opposition; in the case we are going to have such a candidate.</p>\r\n<p>We hope the support will come and is going to be a real one for the project and for the future single candidate. As if to say that PDA will support explicitly and clearly Maia Sandu, will make campaign for her, in the case she is the joint candidate, in order to raise her chances to win. Anyway, the option to exit from the project undermines the chances of Andrei Nastase, who will leave, thus not respecting the declaration and leaving behind an electorate that hoped for a better chance and will migrate, eventually, to Maia Sandu. So, beyond the existing arrangements of Andrei Nastase, the candidacy buries him and removes him out of politics, with a multitude of accusations of not a man of his word and guilt for missing the chance of the single candidate, even with the blame - which he will share with Iurie Leanca - the project of failure to have a right-wing pro-European candidate as president. But I hope it will not get here.</p>\r\n<p>As for the possibilities of enrolling into the second round and about the chances of the pro-Russian second candidate placed in the race, it is too early to talk about the possibility of two pro-Russian candidates in the second round. I have not seen accurate polls, validated by the CEC, but we notice, however, the absence of a run by Renato Usatâi through the country, sometimes very active near Ciubasenco for the needed image transfer. As to the rest, strategic vulnerabilities targeting a large number of actors, campaign kicks have not been given yet, any destructive revelation have not showed up. The fact is that those concerned risk to come out of politics before even entering it seriously, if they do not perform on October 30. In addition many donors and parties will put a padlock on the door after that, without those parties - launched as hope, let us not forget - coming again to catch also the general elections...</p>",

As well as the registered candidates, as those who are still collecting signatures are trying to be present everywhere it is possible and even where it is not possible: in people's home, in schools, at weddings, at christening, at funerals, at annual feet, christening dinner, etc. The most known are even manage to appear in the company of some authorities (usually, high state dignitaries), wishing to take over at least some of their image.",
                "Continut": "<p>Iurie Leanca made a typical electoral move: when he was in Germany, he had meetings with important personalities from Berlin. The peak of his visit was the meeting with Angela Merkel. The German Chancellor made it very clear that supports the candidature of Iurie Leanca at the elections for the President of the Republic of Moldova. But the suggestion given by the leader of one of the most important states from European Union was taken, with cold by the \"pro-European\" right wing, from the Bic river bank. Party leaders, opinion leaders, journalists, all together tried to minimize as much as possible the message from Berlin. Some preferred to overlook the importance of the meeting between Angela Merkel and the leader of PPEM, others did not bother to state that nothing important happened and, more recently, the German Chancellor is not who she used to be anymore. The reaction of some nominees to the Presidential chair can be understood: it is about competition on the same side of the political \"echiquier\" (French word). But the position of the opinion leaders is unclear, who have the mission to explain the unseen side of the politics, from the inside of some meetings and statement which, at first sight are symbolic, formal, but which - in reality - carries a strong political baggage and demand to be taken seriously.  </p>\r\n<p>In the search for support from outside, on the footsteps of Iurie Leanca, went this time to Brussels a PLDM soldier, lead by its new President, Viorel Ciubotaru. Because they don't have nominee of their own, they took with them Maia Sandu, the PAS candidate. In the capital of Belgium, the PLDM-PAS delegation had a meeting the president of the European People's Party. After the meeting with Joseph Daul, the President of PLDM, Viorel Ciubotaru, came before the journalists with the following statement: \"Most of PLDM voters are supporting Maia Sandu\". Thinking that the majority of the National Political Council of PLDM will support the candidature of Maia Sandu at the Presidential elections on Octomber 30<sup>th</sup> 2016.  </p>\r\n<p>The statement of the PLDM leader would blow up the epic quiet appearance of the single candidate from the \"right wing\". As expected, those from the camp of Andrei Nastase were alerted at maximum. The statement of the PLDM President was unexpected by those from PPDA. Just when they thought that their nominee - slowly slowly, when louder, when quieter - will be chosen as a mutual candidate.  </p>\r\n<p>From the information appeared in the public space, we found out that, at first, Maia Sandu and Andrei Nastase had an agreement that the nominee with higher chances will go as the joint candidate. They had a deal also regarding the mechanism of identification of the mutual candidate. They agreed on some sociological studies, realized by some specialized communities, from outside. So far, so good. The problems started when Andrei Nastase realized, when studied the last relevant opinion polls, that he has no chance against Maia Sandu. As a outcome, all the media artillery, all \"experts\" that he has, were put to work, to force Maia Sandu to withdraw in the favor of Andrei Nastase. First of all, they tried to improvise a debate, but, oh dear, it did not work. The PAS candidate did not attend at this game and said: <em>I pas!</em>     </p>\r\n<p>After that it was announced a mobilization for a cabinet from the shadows. This did not work as well, because Maia Sandu did not go. Sandu and her team insisted on the initial agreements, with independent opinion polls. Now, we see the guys from the entourage of the PPDA leader wailing and trying to prove that the opinion pool is not the most adequate method. Engaging in brainstorming exercises, on line, from studios, are coming with the most bizarre proposals: the fact that Nastase is wearing pants, and before the voting urns will be installed, people should choose. This is some kind of <em>primeris</em> (internal Party elections) in the Moldovan way.     </p>\r\n<p>As we can easily see, the most restless from all the nominees is the PPDA candidate, Andrei Nastase. Pushed insistently from behind, Nastase transformed in a true Figaro of the politics from Chisinau. Offering himself in all possible and impossible alliances, both enrolling or withdrawing itself from the geopolitical cymbal, he is ready for anything, just to get on the top. The most funny thing that I heard from the followers of Andrei Nastase is the story that he would be the anti-oligarchic candidate!...       </p>\r\n<p>Meanwhile, after some massive pressures and betrayal accusations, the President of PLDM was bound to specify: \"PLDM did not decide yet whom to support\". Therefore, the denouement is delayed. Although, it is clear that as a <em>single candidate</em> will be Andrei Nastase or... nobody!   </p>",

                "subtitlu": "",
                "lead": "We recorded a lot of discussions about the acceptability of Igor Dodon, President of PSRM, as the president of Moldova. It is true, firstly, that if this is the free choice of the Moldovan citizens, if Dodon is chosen in a democratic scrutiny as President, everyone will respect this choice, which, however, will be defining and symbolic for Chisinau. Therefore I wanted to go over what it means, what it carries and how life with Dodon as president will.",
                "Continut": "<p>First of all, the main subjects of Dodon's campaign – who is not confronting anyone, does not appear with anyone, is not entering in the studio with anyone and runs like hell from any public or TV debate, preferring only the press releases and arranged interviews, being alone - are: a) the strategic reorientation of the Republic of Moldova towards Russia, towards Customs Union and Euro-Asian Union (from which Lukashenko announced that want's to exit; as for Nazarbaev, invite him to Chisinau and he will be the biggest promoter of the idea of <em>not joining the Russian project</em>, because his country, Kazakhstan, lost all the markets to Russia, Russia that took all she could through his Southern neighbor and eve tried a few times to disturb the arranged natural succession); after that, b) federalization of Moldova and its transit in the right side of the Dniester, through the veto vote of Chisinau, if it will ever, in time, would like to go through Orient; finally, c) the left wing government of the guys that have money, enriched from the political life and public functions like Dodon himself, and so on!...  </p>\r\n<p>The symbolical message send by Moldova if it will elect Dodon as president will be one that will mean <em>the detachment of the western path</em>, from the integration in the EU. Some (even diplomats form Chisinau) will be very relieved because: if Moldova would step seriously on the path of reforms and knocked at EU's door, with all the chances, achieved reforms, with institutions build and running, with corruption combating updated to the present day, it would be difficult to find reasons for blocking its path. This way the things are much more easy to solve, the motives would be on top: the Republic of Moldova is not serious in its orientation, it is doubting by the chosen path, there is no real support and the European choice is proving to be not sustainable.  </p>\r\n<p>In other words, voting Dodon is<em> a window towards instability</em>. It is already been announced: Dodon wants anticipated elections and to sweep everything into his net. A normal thing from a politician, even it is harder to understand if you are a businessman, who sees all parties as corporations or companies. Probably, not from the first moment, because he needs to take over the control and the institutions, but, in 6 months, Dodon would have the power to do whatever he pleases, without being supported by the majority or Parliament. Dodon is not Nicolae Timofti - we will see how much will regret Moldova the decency and the firmness of oppinions - but a Voronin, with the most occupied seats in the Parliament, which he is leading firmly.        </p>\r\n<p>So, Probably the first moves will be to pause the European path and to reevaluate the change of azimuth. A period of reflection as long he is taking over the power and its tools. Meanwhile, the speeches about federalization and attacks towards Romania will be loud enough to enter in conflict with the Parliament majority and the Government, to resort even to arbitration at Constitutional Court.    </p>\r\n<p>So, one more time: the instability, the break with EU and, most certainly, with Romania, the ceasing of material help and programs that are fated to European reforms, not recession with Russia, that has no money not for its self, neither for Dodon and the Republic of Moldova, and risks to stop paying in the next year (they cut funding in Donbass).  </p>\r\n<p>More than that, the reforms that started are going to yield results: this means reorganizations, therefore staff reductions, increasing energy prices, with bills which will be seen in March. The dissapointed people will go out, obviously, in the street, with the stimulus of the party, and this strengthened by the election of Dodon. Supported by the President, the overthrow of the majority and government is, in such circumstances, only a matter of time. And if someone moves on the front, and arrests - deserved or abusive - are all in President's hand; because the road to the Asian steppes and the Eurasian Union of Putin does not need the rule of law, but only a Grandfather who tells his people where they get off.  </p>\r\n<p>Even worse than the strategic reorientation, the messages to partners, financing cut and the political instability, respectively the fall into authoritarianism of the state leadership, is, though, the <em>irreversibility of the Western road. </em>Practically, <em>if Moldova makes a mistake this time, it is her last mistake,</em> and the gates of the European path are closing for at least one generation. Everything, of course, for the \"flourishing\" socialism of Dodon and from the play with fire of some warlock apprentices, that have no idea how people feel and react, citizens, social groups, state institutions, which are not engaged in the commercial-economic mechanism, dominated and ordered by the unaccounted money circuit.  </p>\r\n<p>However, there is a more black perspective. The presidential elections, especially those that will imply a real opponent fro Dodon, will divide the society. Again! Besides the blocs that Moldova already has. In addition, the victory of Dodon will be hardly accepted by the pro-European voters. Individual solutions exist, but only at the level of one half of the voters. The active ones who also want perspectives, cannot go with the others, will have an unpredictable reaction and I am really afraid to see even more violent contesting episodes after the election of Dodon. With also unpredictable consequences. </p>\r\n<p>For Romania, which is in the electoral campaign period in both cases, as in the first, as in the second round of the ballot, the impact of the elections in Moldova will be a major one. We are not in 2014 anymore, at the presidential elections, where the vote preceded the ballot and had a result of maintenance of the European vector. The magnitude of changes - as the eventual one of instability - will put the last month of the campaign in Romania under the empire of an endless debate about culprits, responsibilities, action or inaction, a fact that threatens to alter deeply the voting results, in any case, to pick up any help for a country that elects Dodon and that goes to Russia. A complex equation, that raises the stake at the direct presidential elections in Chisinau, also the responsibility of the voters from the Republic of Moldova for their own destiny. The same as underlines the responsibilities and blames for the right-wing pro-European leaders, who, due to ambition and pride, did not respect their commitments and thus diminished the chances of a pro-European president in Chisinau.</p>",

There are exactly 100 of them, 5 more than in 2014, which is, undoubtedly, a progress. According to the law, the maximum capacity of these polling stations is 300,000 voters.</p>\r\n<p>We remind you that 10 days ago several representatives of the diaspora <a href=\"http://www.vitalie-vovc.com/2016/09/chisinaul-nu-mai-are-nevoie-de-voturile-emigratilor.html\" target=\"_blank\">launched an open letter</a> where they were requesting, before the decision of CEC to come, that the elections in 2016 to take place at least in the same conditions as in 2014, which means a sufficient number of polling stations abroad and the possibility to identify the voters inclusively with expired foreign passports.  </p>\r\n<p>As we can see, the first point was validated. However, since CEC decided to open an impressive number of polling stations abroad, the second decision, which refers to the validity of the passports, should come too! Otherwise, multiple citizens of Moldova will not be able to vote and this stations will register a number of voters below the one in 2014. If for the emigrants from the Russian Federation the valid passport is mandatory, because with it you can enter the country without visa (and the possibilities of the citizens stop here), for the emigrants from the western countries the situation is different. Although we can travel freely with biometric passports, the Moldovan passport does not allow you to carry on a professional activity, for example. But we must remember that this measure is relatively recent, and a lot of Moldovan people will rather to receive documents in those countries that gives you more rights and protection. We can not blame them for this and for the fact that they want to escape the illegality, isn't it?</p>\r\n<p>The argument that is illegal to use false documents does not apply for the simple fact that there is a difference between \"false\" and \"expired\". In the worst case we could say that this papers are of no value, but never false. But then we could ask another questions: to what purpose serve this documents? A rational mind would say to identify the voter and to avoid fraud. I do not think that the validity of this documents will help us to identify the voter, and there were no frauds from the west in the past. We cannot place ourselves in the logic of avoiding the frauds <em>ex ante</em>, limiting more and more the constitutional right to vote of the citizen. CEC has all the necessary resources to verify <em>à posteriori </em>if there were any frauds.     </p>\r\n<p>More than that, a less participation at this poll would make a good argument to reduce afterwards the number of voting stations outside. Cause until now there were a straight correlation between the number of voters and the number of voting stations: </p>\r\n<table border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\">\r\n<tbody>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>\r\n<p><strong>Poll</strong></p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<p><strong>No. of the poll sections</strong></p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<p><strong>No of the voters</strong></p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>\r\n<p>April 5<sup>th</sup> 2009</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<p align=\"center\">33</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<p align=\"center\">16916</p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>\r\n<p>November 28<sup>th</sup> 2010</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<p align=\"center\">75</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<p align=\"center\">64199</p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n<tr>\r\n<td>\r\n<p>November 30<sup>th</sup> 2014</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<p align=\"center\">95</p>\r\n</td>\r\n<td>\r\n<p align=\"center\">73311</p>\r\n</td>\r\n</tr>\r\n</tbody>\r\n</table>\r\n<p>For all three polls, the validity of the passports were not took into consideration.  </p>\r\n<p id=\"yui_3_5_0_1_1475065778914_39253\">Finally, I offer you a comparing list of the voting stations.

In USA and Turkey it will be with one more, and the citizens from Japan will have one voting station.

No, not our Calarasi, their Calarasi, from Baragan. But this does not matter, the fact that I was in a state of full Nirvana madness matters.",

I remember that all the youngsters were in a trance, and those who had walkmans were strolling and waggling in the rhythm of <em>Come As You Are</em>. … Only then I found out about Nirvana. I was telling you: I have always been a simple fogey provincial from Balti. When you think that <em>Nevermind, </em>has <a href=\"/en/news/culture/1120/25-years-of-Nirvana's-Nevermind.htm\">exactly the same age</a> as Moldova. We are living in a continuous nirvana since then…</p>\r\n<p><strong>FILM FESTIVAL IN CAHUL</strong> Not only bad news come from Cahul. Between 25 and 29 September in this city took place the International Documentary Film Festival for Social Change, <a href=\"http://www.platzforma.md/vasile-ernu-va-garantez-ca-o-sa-vedeti-lucruri-cutremuratoare-profunde-care-ne-rascolesc-puternic-si-ne-pun-pe-ginduri-despre-moldox/\">MOLDOX</a>. If it became traditional, it would great!</p>\r\n<p><strong>IT MOVED US</strong> I never thought that I would include an earthquake in the good news. Still, this is what I am going to do. Probably, the only event that launched so many collective and adequate reactions this week was the Saturday earthquake. Oh, maybe except some individuals who dream to become presidents… However, no one considers them adequate for a long time.</p>\r\n<p>From the good ones – that’s all… Now, about the really sad one:</p>\r\n<p><strong>SHOGUN DOES NOT EXIST ANYMORE</strong> I don’t know if someone made me laugh more than Divertis. It is exactly the humor that I like: shifting, intelligent, „with many floors” – a delight! Ioan Gyuri Pascu was probably the most batty among them. He was fume and fret! <a href=\"/ro/stiri/cultura/1154/A-murit-actorul-IOAN-GYURI-PASCU-Fostul-membru-al-grupului-%E2%80%9EDivertis%E2%80%9D-avea-55-de-ani.htm\">And he burnt</a>… too soon.

Exactly 16!</a> To wonder – nothing else. Several serious candidates and a wonder of jogglers. I do not want to put the chestnuts in the fire, that is why I leave you to choose them. You know, as in that short poem: „To divide them in two groups...”</p>\r\n<p><strong>100 POLLING STATIONS ABROAD </strong><a href=\"/ro/stiri/politic/1185/Guvernul-va-deschide-100-de-sec%C8%9Bii-de-vot-peste-hotare-la-alegerile-preziden%C8%9Biale.htm\">So many will be opened</a>. If the voting with expired passports will be interdicted, these efforts (and these spent money) will not serve for anything! The Parliament should decide once and for all! The voting should be done in the <a href=\"/en/news/editorials/1274/Vitalie-VOVC--CEC's-decision-polling-stations-without-voters.htm\">same conditions as in 2014</a>!</p>\r\n<p><strong>BAHAMAS DODON</strong> The law stipulates: „(4) Canceling the registration shall be done at the request of the Central Electoral Commission, by a final court decision that notices: a) the use of undeclared financial and material funds or exceeding the expenditure above the threshold mean from the election fund by the candidate; b) the use  of funds from abroad by the candidate;” Who obeys the law in our country? <a href=\"https://www.rise.md/articol/banii-lui-dodon-din-bahamas/\">RISE publishes a material </a>where Dodon and PSRM are financed by the Russians by an offshore firm, and his candidacy is registered at CEC very easily. By the way, Ciubasenco is also included in the scheme, the candidate of Usatai.</p>\r\n<p><strong>CRIMINAL SAGA</strong> Speaking of Usatai, Veaceslav Balacci <a href=\"/ro/stiri/editorial/1078/%D0%A7%D0%B5%D0%B1%D1%83%D1%80%D0%B0%D1%88%D0%BA%D0%B0--%D0%93%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%B0-A-criminal-saga.htm\">issues a very curious material</a> about the adventures of Usatai. Not that we would find out something absolutely new. But it's good to remind to us what character we are at grips with. The Prosecutor's Office should deal with him, in fact, but we have to ...</p>\r\n<p><em><strong>NASTASE GATE</strong></em> We find out some curious stuff about Nastase also. For example, that he <a href=\"/en/news/political/1266/FOTO--Nastase-met-with-Klimenco-the-Honorary-President-of-Shor's-Party.htm\">met with Climenco</a>, the man of Shor. Absolutely accidentally, it seems. And his patron, <a href=\"/ro/stiri/editorial/1138/%C3%8Ent%C3%A2lnire-Usat%C3%AEi-%C5%A2opa-la-Baden-Baden!.htm\">Topa, with Usatai at Baden-Baden</a>. Viorel <a href=\"/ro/stiri/social/1321/Viorel-%C8%9Aopa-%C8%99i-cumnatul-acestuia-condamna%C8%9Bi-la-9-%C8%99i-respectiv-7-ani-de-%C3%AEnchisoare.htm\">Topa receives in the meantime several years</a> of conviction for his personal collection. He gathered 15 already. And Ciubasenco, the candidate of Usatai is included in Dodon's schemes ... Oh dear! It spins your head ...</p>\r\n<p><strong>DO YOU WANT ME TO WRITE A COMPROMISING EVIDENCE?  GIVE ME A PEN AND PAPER!</strong> Some <a href=\"http://www.ziarulnational.md/reactia-judecatorului-ion-muruianu-care-ar-fi-primit-de-la-plahotniuc-30-de-mii-de-dolari\" target=\"_blank\">handwritten pamphlets</a> that allegedly Plaha required to pay tens of thousands of dollars to some judges or senior officials was thrown in the press. I think the most appropriate <a href=\"/ro/stiri/social/1293/Morari-cere-verificarea-a%C5%9Fa-zisei-liste-a-func%C5%A3ionarilor-%E2%80%9Epremia%C5%A3i%E2%80%9D-de-Plahotniuc.htm\" target=\"_blank\">response is Morari's</a>. Basically, the guys who published these papers must respond. I am sick of this kind of scandals. I did once said: either these guys are lodged complaints at the Prosecutor's Office make a if prosecutors are covering up, or will answer for libel. And the press ... How can you publish something like that without trying at least to investigate the case?...</p>\r\n<p><strong>THE GOVERNMENT ASSUMED THE RESPONSIBILITY THAT WE WILL PAY</strong> \"I Congratulate the Government from Chisinau for the achieved results. You proved that you have courage. Go further and you will have our full support in the realization of reforms\", <a href=\"/ro/stiri/politic/1065/Nuland-%C3%AEi-recomand%C4%83-lui-Filip-s%C4%83-nu-rateze-%C8%99ansa-oferit%C4%83-de-FMI-%C8%99i-Comisia-European%C4%83.htm\">stated Victoria Nuland</a>. And <a href=\"/en/news/business/1180/Filip-Government-assumes-responsibility-for-7-laws-from-the-financial-banking-package-asked-by-IMF.htm\" target=\"_blank\">the Government went further</a>. It assumed the responsibility. The Billion is public debt! But we new this already a long time ago, didn't we? Inclusively those who are criticizing vehemently the decision! But did anyone came with solutions? With proposals? Here, the IMF proposed! But with out IMF somebody realizes how much it would cost us? Generally, this story, at least for me, is becoming increasingly blurred. (Or rather, it is becoming clearer, but a little different. A kind of confirmation of what I thought in the begging). Here Kroll say that <a href=\"/en/news/business/1215/NBM-Kroll-has-identified-more-than-USD-600-million-Beneficiaries-extend-beyond-the-Shor-Group.htm\" target=\"_blank\">they have identified 600 millions</a>. But where are the other 400? The <a href=\"/ro/stiri/politic/1218/Candu-taie-ca-n-curechi-specula%C5%A3iile-despre-transformarea-garan%C8%9Biilor-de-stat-%C3%AEn-datorie-public%C4%83.htm\" target=\"_blank\">arguments of Candu</a> or <a href=\"/ro/stiri/economic/1255/Arma%C5%9Fu-Cet%C4%83%C5%A3eanul-nu-va-sim%C5%A3i-miliardul-convertit-%C3%AEn-datorie-de-stat.htm\" target=\"_blank\">Armasu</a>, at least in the sense of fairness, also deserves attention. Only I do not understand why the obligations needs to be redireted necessarily to NBM. What if we would suggest to people? I mean to be distributed as widely as possible. In fact, it would mean that people borrow money to the state, but will recover them with interest. I think this is the only way we will not have to pay ... But I feel that this solution is pretty utopian and naive. That you can not put bonds on people's neck, could you?</p>\r\n<p><strong>THE RESOLUTION PROJECT PRO PLAHA</strong>: Two congressmen <a href=\"/ro/stiri/politic/1270/%E2%80%9EJaful-secolului%E2%80%9D-discutat-%C3%AEn-SUA-Doi-congresmani-cer-sanc%C5%A3iuni-pentru-mai-mul%C5%A3i-demnitari-din-RM.htm\" target=\"_blank\">have proposed a draft resolution in the US</a>. I will tell you just what I did when I came across this news. I read the project. I found it rarely stupid. I sought who are the authors. Two of the most ... Republicans.  Come on, I will silece my self before I create a diplomatic scandal. However, these characters exist in all parliaments. Only my mind involuntarily flew elsewhere: Republicans&gt; Trump&gt; Putin&gt; Nastase ... Ptfu ... Moscow's hand again.</p>\r\n<p>Otherwise, how do I say? For example if in France Le Pen had requested an investigation against Plahotniuc, certainly the credibility before the French state establishment's would have soared (even if he did not know about anybody anything until this requirement ... ). Here are some American paradoxes ... The situation is very interesting, namely in terms of the protagonists involved in this circus. Finally, Candu went as well to the US. Just is case.</p>\r\n<p>What else could deserve some attention? </p>\r\n<p>-             <a href=\"/en/news/international/1265/International-investigation-the-MH17-plane-was-shot-down-by-the-separatists-with-the-Russian-Buk.htm\" target=\"_blank\">MH17 was shot down by the Russians</a>. That is said in the international investigation. And we all knew about this, but reconstitution is impressive. </p>\r\n<p>-              <a href=\"/ro/stiri/social/1226/Dou%C4%83-focare-cu-suspiciune-de-infectare-cu-pesta-porcin%C4%83-depistate-la-Dondu%C8%99eni.htm\">Swine fever at Donduseni</a>.

                "lead": "The balanced strategy of Romania to watch the international developments is obvious also in the extremely solid commitments assumed at the beginning of the week in Washington DC, where took place the fifth reunion of the Task-Force for the implementation of the Joint Declaration regarding the implementation of the Strategic Partnership for XXI Century between Romania and the United States of America.",
                "Continut": "<p>In a various presence on multiple areas with the representatives of the Chancellery of the Prime-Minister, MAE, Ministry of Energy, Ministry of National Defense, Ministry of Economy, the reunion ended with multiple agreements and a mutual statement, published on the site of the State Department and the Romanian Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Unfortunately the document passed unseen through the multitude of political and electoral local events although it must end any type of controversy or differences between Washington and Bucharest aiming to tackle the regional topics of interest for our country. </p>\r\n<p>As I was saying, Romania proved its balance in dealing with the problems after what the President, Klaus Johannis, addressed with shades of difference the topic of the European Army, who aroused many controversies before the informal summit from Bratislava and noted the approach differences through extreme options of the transatlantic rupture of EU-USA spread by various officials and analysts. Therefore, while the constitution of the presidential commission regarding the country project and the debate regarding the energizing of the European project was announced, Washington confirmed in very specific and favorable terms, the strategic partnership with USA as well as mutual support in relevant strategic zones.   </p>\r\n<p>This round of the Romanian-US strategic Dialog, after 5 years since the adoption of the Joint Declaration, highlighted the concrete prospects of development covering extremely sensitive and important areas for our country, that are assumed directly and open to the strategic American partner. Firstly, in the joint statement, is noted the basis of cooperation, respectively the commitment for democratic values - the rule of law, free market, respecting the human rights and interpersonal relations - and the importance of the ongoing efforts to promote democracy, the rule of law and good governance for preservation of an open and sustainable society, being noticed efforts and progresses of our country but also the posture, for example in law enforcement, responsible governance and fight against corruption.</p>\r\n<p>However, perhaps the most important element remains the assuming of joint projects in areas of direct interest for Romania - Republic of Moldova, the Western Balkans and other areas. Besides, in the security domain, the operationalization defense system against ballistic missiles from Deveselu, and cooperation within bilateral frame and NATO to ensure the commitments implementation of the Allied Warsaw Summit, in particular the establishment of the multinational brigade led by Romania, ensuring the presence of Allied air and sea defense in the Black Sea region, supported by an enhanced program of joint and multinational exercises and training. Other areas of cooperation aimed at information warfare, counter-terrorism and cyber security.</p>\r\n<p>The energy, in particular the interconnection of gas pipelines between Romania, Bulgaria, Hungary and Austria, but also between Romania and Moldova, as well as developing offshore reserves in the Black Sea, further investment in the long term in the exploration and production in Romania, advanced technology sectors, are creating areas of cooperation with major regional advantages for our country. The common commitment is to support TTIP -  the transatlantic partnership for investment and trade between the US and the EU. In addition the US is committed through this document to support Romania's inclusion in the Visa Waiver Program based on respect by Romania and Romanian citizens of enhancing security and employment law related American Program of visa free travel in the US.</p>",

                "lead": "I write this editorial before the formal deadline of the application submission period for candidatures, which means that we do not know yet how looks the future list of the candidates for the Presidency of the Republic of Moldova. However, it seems relevant to talk about the latest opinion poll CBS-Axa IDIS Viitorul, highly relevant through its real target: public satisfaction level in the state institutions.",
                "Continut": "<p>The list, and the registered scores show a campaign with no horizon, no hope. Voters - citizens, taxpayers from Moldova - have no clearly defined horizon of expectation and ambition level (i.e., confidence in the future) is marginal. Politics, especially, and the central institutions of all shapes and powers are at the bottom of any ranking; while the rejection in a body of politics and the political class seems definitive.</p>\r\n<p><em>If we look strictly at the political options to the presidential elections, we see a complete rejection of politics.</em> Although voting in the upcoming election, the majority of the citizens with a right to vote of the Republic of Moldova are ranking the position to reject everyone, to not know or refuse to speak. Very high quota is given to the poll (with an error margin of 3%) a variable even more relevant for the consulted public. Exactly this thing displays differences with the fixed results, at decimal level, presented by the authors, in the context of several insignificant or negligible differences. </p>\r\n<p>It seemed to me more important the analysis that is offered by the perspective of the vote, overlapped on the notoriety, the growing reserve of different candidates. That is why I do not hide to point it out. Therefore, the only one with a positive quota between pros and cons is Dmitri Ciubasenko. Among the candidates with chances, (the man of Usatii outperforms even Leanca), he’s got great air [to refer to the time spent in the air between a jump's take-off and landing in sports – Eds.], the largest space to grow, without talking here about the capacity, resources, strategy or the necessary time for performing. Late entry in the competition seems to be a handicap and the size of the growth capacity we will see after the first launching polls of the candidacy. However the verifiable speed can be encouraging for the future presence in a second round, if other conditions are met, and \"Our Party\" candidate is shown as an important pretender. In the circumstances, the pro-European right-wing opposition should consider him carefully.</p>\r\n<p>As for the rest, the reputation, the awareness is so great for the known figures that the expansion space is limited, except perhaps for the PAS and PPDA candidates, Maia Sandu and Andrei Nastase, who have some reserves. More importantly, Igor Dodon seems to exhaust the reserves to grow in the first round, according to the preliminary data, although a survey with the second option has not been made yet (and do not know if it will be made). The score of the Communists Party rules out the boycott option, so Moldova will have a president, most likely today Igor Dodon.</p>\r\n<p>Perhaps most interesting is the dispute concerning the right wing pro-European unity. As we already analyzed the chances, I'll just say that the withdrawal of two of the three opponents; (I've included Leanca, who still retains the votes of former PLDM) can be a serious chance to enter the second round and the victory in the second round. Which of the three can beat Dodon? Any of them, in normal conditions, although Andrei Nastase seems, paradoxically, the most disliked by voters of other parties, closely followed by former Prime Minister Leanca. It does not mean that this value judgment is accurate because, again, we do not study the second option or the second round, as the behavior of voters in round 1.</p>\r\n<p>If considering the compatibility of electorates, Andrei Nastase seems rather closer to Igor Dodon and Renato Usatii (I mean the opinion leaders / parties) than to Maia Sandu and Iurie Leanca. Basically, the calibration survey does not give us answers about the option among the three, unless puts the top two in the foreground, in order Maia Sandu - Andrei Nastase. On the other hand, such structures are lacking here party structures and voters are rather young, the volatile nature of the vote may be the most important, compared with the stability of communists, socialists or even \"Our Party\".</p>\r\n<p>The survey confirms a preeminence, though small and questionable one, of Maia Sandu over Andrei Nastase, while strong trends reinforce this view, once Andrei Nastase is falling steadily, and Maia Sandu, rather, increases slightly. This is why matters the final formula from the beginning, to support or not the single candidate of the right wing opposition at the presidential elections (with the withdrawal from the race of the other counter-candidate), respectively, the speed and capacity to increase of Dmitri Ciubasenko (not to say the <em>determination</em>, if he takes the electorate from the market, from the Communists that do not candidate or bring new voters, as did Renato Usatai).</p>\r\n<p>After the beginning of the campaign, it depends heavily on how the actions of the campaign will look like and their vigor, as well as the visibility and thrown money on the market. Not to be ignored, of course, the hits below the belt, disclosures and other miseries as not to ignore any technical issues that will be involved: parties members of the voting committees, lawyers of each candidate. So everything is in the game!</p>\r\n<p>Unfortunately, we can not make more detailed predictions or accurate now, because many elements are missing, as well as qualitative results of the studies of various parties, studies which help formulate the programs and define behavior models and the targets of seduction candidates. As the campaign enters in full action of public persuasion and new surveys or studies are proposed, we will be able to calibrate the real chances each. However one thing must be said since now: the exit from the stage of the \"bunnies\" (candidates with little chance that can entangle the race) would be good, such as the qualified losers going home. However, as we talk about the right to be elected, each evaluates his own chance and defines hiss behavior. Therefore, we have to wait!</p>",

                "lead": "I was watching on Friday night, at the BBC Hard Talk, an interview with the Russian Minister of Foreign Affairs, Sergey Lavrov.",
                "Continut": "<p>It comes after another interview, with Dmitry Peskov, the speaker of the Russian President Vadimir Putin, a day earlier. As I was in Brussels at a high level NATO workshop , the interviews were more shocking through its discrepancy towards the reality and the current situation of the Russian Federation in Crimea, East of Ukraine, and Syria, in regard to the international community, with the UN itself, although he is a permanent member of the Security Council.          </p>\r\n<p>I leave aside the interview with Peskov, which was the usual note. I am sick of  propagandists and oath defenders for any undone thing of the Russian President and I saw a thousand of them. However, at the intelligence level and knowledge of international interface, a custom, decency, the things that can be done and that cannot, the Russian Foreign Minister Lavrov is a master. The same thing and in the relation to media. But his performance was memorable.</p>\r\n<p>Dressed up and with a make up that you could not tell his age, Sergey Lavrov wanted to appear jovial, extremely sure of himself during the whole interview. Although it was a fair-play interview, covering all the actual topics, and the journalist did not spear him at all, Sergey Lavrov wanted to give the impression that he always plays in offence, that he is always in the position to attack the counterpart that he defined for himself, as otherwise in US, the actions of the Americans, the President Obama and his counterpart, John Kerry. This kind of behavior, in a paradoxical way, underlined, the fact that the real situation is different from what he states, Lavrov had moments of absolute awkwardness, through his inadequate tone, unusual for him as a diplomat, and for the gravity of the discussed topics. A general freaking feeling of a character that laughs like a fool in the market when someone tells him that his house is burning!          </p>\r\n<p>Sergey Lavrov answered no questions. There was no way to. Any real answer would emphasize the defensive posture ought to be, the explanations that he should provide, the unpleasant answers that would have to give to defend the country and its aggressive military actions. He did not even chose, as Peskov before him, on the eve, to pass some responsibilities to his \"fellow military men\". No. Lavrov has received all the questions with a superior smile and often inappropriate  and responded to all the turning mirror from themselves and pointing to the third party. The third party being the guilty service of USA.</p>\r\n<p>As a banal provincial propagandist,  rivaling with boorishness of his ambassador to Bucharest, Kuzmin, Sergey Lavrov answered all the questions that made him responsible for and were accusing Russia on the \"us as us, but look at what did the US do\". As the cucumber from the Cucurbitaceae family, from the skit played admirably by Florin Piersic, whatever the lesson that he was asked, the student embodied by the great actor was going to the lesson that he knew. So, Lavrov, whatever question was, the answer was inevitable that US did not separate the moderate opposition of Al Nusrat Front, a terrorist organization, with variations of an attack - USA protects Al Nusrat. Asked about the civilian victims of airstrikes, about the slaughter of civilians in Aleppo's hospitals, about the UN and Red Cross humanitarian aid convoy attack, everywhere the answer was the same: US did not separate the moderate opposition of Al Nusrat Front.</p>\r\n<p>The interview reached a high rate of embarrassment when the question of bombing civilians was asked again, Lavrov asked for evidence, and when the evidence was presented, he denied them and said that US coined the term collateral damage! Faced with the fact that US apologize for errors, Lavrov said that he does not have to apologize for. As the US Government is guilty of intentionally killing civilians by the Russians, because they have give a name to the military actions aimed at legitimate targets, but hits accidentally civilians as well! Neither the Malaysia Airlines plane crash over the Donbas had no logic: he did not seen the evidence and the very commission of inquiry, in the final report, reserves the right to bring more evidence (all to condemn Moscow as well, but this was not underlined). In fact, the entire interview took place while the UN and all its components speak about Russian war crimes in Syria, Donbas and shooting down of the plane. Lavrov's reaction proves that the logical and factual arguments have been exhausted and the Russians have left only the propaganda.</p>",

                "lead": "The Supreme Council of National Defence, the supreme institution of security of Romania, headed by the President of Romania and that represents the mechanism for the realization of the executive duties of the President in matters of national security, foreign policy and Defence, has discussed at the Tuesday meeting, on September 27th, the situation in the Republic Moldova, a point that was not originally announced on the official agenda of the CSAT, but it was pointed out by the Romanian President Klaus Johannis, after the reunion, in view of the direct presidential elections and the possibility of  strategic reorientation of Moldova.",
                "Continut": "<p class=\"Default\">Here are the terms:</p>\r\n<p class=\"Default\">\"Also, in international relations, we had an item on the agenda which concerns the relationship between Romania and Moldova, an issue that is very important to us, a subject that interests me very much. I noticed, in the briefing made by the Minister of Foreign Affairs, a thing that is apparent to the naked eye. Our relationship should become better, more efficient, more pragmatic and more predictable.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Default\">Consequently, to improve the approach of the relationship between Romania and Moldova, it has been decided to work on a strategy, a strategy, this time, on the medium and long term, that will determine how we position ourselves in this relationship. Meanwhile, political development in Moldova has shown us all that pro-European parties have difficulties, I am talking about pro-European parties in Moldova, surely, all these difficulties were seen very well after the elections they had in 2014.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Default\">There is, therefore, a requirement for an improved relationship. The fact that Romania supports Moldova with significant funding is just a start. We believe that we need a deeper engagement, in the economic relations between Romania and Moldova, and there is further need of our commitment for building and strengthening the democratic institutions. These things, all of which would be set out in the strategy that we would prepare for the end of this year.\"</p>\r\n<p class=\"Default\">In addition, in the question and answer session, the subject returned:</p>\r\n<p class=\"Default\">\"Our request in the CSAT was like as soon as possible to establish this working group, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, with the Foreign Intelligence Service, with the Romanian Intelligence Service, with the Presidential Administration, and this strategy should address all the issues that are relevant in the relationship between Romania and Moldova. However from the start, in the discussion that I had at CSAT, I remarked that we must make a very clear distinction between the very serious approaches that we may have in the relationship between Romania and Moldova and populist-electoral approaches that may occur in the coming weeks and following months, because we will have our electoral campaign for parliamentary elections and, almost simultaneously, we will have a campaign for presidential elections in Moldova.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Default\">Journalist: The discussion about a possible union is included in the populist zone?</p>\r\n<p class=\"Default\">The President of Romania, Mr. Klaus Johannis: \"The discussion about a possible union we will treat in the strategy which we will discuss in CSAT at the end of the year.\"</p>\r\n<p class=\"Default\">Not incidentally, the CSAT meeting came shortly after the Washington's fifth meeting between the Romanian-American ministeries at the Strategic Partnership for XXI Century, which issued a new policy statement published on the website of the State Department and decides unequivocally the Romanian-American cooperation on all areas of strategic interest of Romania. Moldova and the Western Balkans are being noted explicitly in the declaration. Beyond its strong commitment to joint action, the declaration finally closed the launched doubts of the Ambassador Pettit to Chisinau, on the occasion of Moldova’s Independence Day and rejects any formula of divergence between Bucharest and Washington on strategies concerning Moldova.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Default\">Not lastly, should be noted the welcoming, unanticipated initially, of the Minister of Defense of the Republic of Moldova, Anatol Salaru, by Romania's President after numerous receptions at his counterpart and the Minister of Foreign Affairs, another visit and symbolic reception, that is enclosing the highly debated theme in Chisinau under the rule of direct presidential elections, but also by a group of Romanian agitators involved in the campaign in Chisinau, on Romania's position near the Government and especially near the Minister of Defence, Anatol Salaru.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Default\">A consistent signal meant to gainsay the aberrations regarding the support of Vladimir Plahotniuc by Romania - a campaign that aims to affect Bucharest in public consciousness from Moldova, but also to fade a East-West battle of the geopolitical influences through a pseudo-battle pro/anti-oligarch, where Romania should be placed in the wrong side of the barricade. Romania supports Moldova's European path, reforms and institution building, not Plahotniuc or any other political leader or presidential candidate who never got to see inside the Cotroceni Palace. In addition, the President Klaus Johannis only shook hands with the government officials, not incidentally the Minister's of Defense, Salaru, last week, and not Leanca, Nastase, Maia Sandu or, God-forbid, Dodon has not been welcomed by the President. Here the waters have separated and are specific enough to make blush of all kinds of consultants  that are claiming to support that, because they know what the Romanian state wants or what are its options.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Default\">Now, returning to the big messages about CSAT meeting, they are following:</p>\r\n<p class=\"Default\">- The relationship with Moldova is of prime importance for Romania, and it must become better, more efficient, more pragmatic and more predictable.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Default\">- Romania develops a medium and long-term strategy discussed until the end of the year, which will provide, in addition to the important funding, deep economic relations and involvement in the construction and strengthening of democratic institutions in Moldova.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Default\">- This strategy must address all the relevant issues in the relationship between Romania and Moldova, making a distinction between serious approaches and populist-electoral approaches. The discussion about a possible union will be treated strategically, in the CSAT, at the end of the year, in the purpose of today's items that are affecting Romania by such public actions and populist-election statements.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Default\">At the public level, the interpretations have exceeded the statements of the President, therefore, it must be emphasized very clearly that Romania supports the institutional building, economic cooperation and financing Moldova, supports the actions of the Government from Chisinau - as long as it makes reforms - and supports the choice of a future pro-European president, and not any presidential candidate, a strongman of the regime, even if he is an oligarch. Not the union in populist terms, which will manifest in the following period: in Chisinau, in the presidential campaign at Bucharest - during the general elections. This is Romania's position, reflected in the statements of Romanian President, Klaus Johannis, and everything that exceeds these statements are often speculations and malicious interpretations.</p>\r\n<p class=\"Default\">Regarding the debate about the union in the public space, they are the preserve of NGO's or political parties in the campaign, but they affect the interests of Romania. And the official approach is about institution building strategy towards Moldova, of mechanisms and democratic institutions not destroy them in a perspective of a unionist solution, on foot, possibly with revisionism and change of borders on Dniester River. This is the official approach of Romania's president Klaus Johannis direct statements.</p>",

                "lead": "The electoral campaign for the presidential election started now officially. We know the list of registered candidates. We have of all kinds: system-candidates and anti-system-candidates, pro-European candidates and pro-Russian candidates, constructive candidates and destructive; shortly, we have spoilers and clones. We have everything, the saying of \"Planeta Moldova\" show! Is that what we wanted? And yes, and no. Do we need this now? Surely, not! A thing is clear: most majority of citizens hope that the results of the elections will influence for the better the way things are done in the country.",
                "Continut": "<p>Initially there were 25 candidates, but succeeded to register only 16 of them, real chances have 5, will remain 2 and after that only 1. If considering the electoral segment that bet on the favorite of the campaign, Igor Dodon, in the second tour his opponent will be someone from the Maia Sandu, Andrei Nastase, Marian Lupu or Iurie Leanca list. That is what the surveys say. As for the independents, the surveys are taking into considerations only Valeriu Ghiletchii. </p>\r\n<p>Actually, on the electoral ring, there are three forces that are fighting. One of them is represented by the exponents of the <em>Western vector</em>. It is amazing how viable can be an existent project when you have at your disposal a massive propaganda arsenal and a politically disillusioned and intoxicated citizen. Dodon have the highest chances. His accedes to the second round is guaranteed inclusively by the other candidates, that operate on the same electoral segment (quite commanding, we can say). Here, from PN's behalf, is competing Dmitri Ciubashenko, who's chances are illusory. </p>\r\n<p>The second force is formed by the exponents of the Topa and Filat clan. Although Topa brothers are condemned by the court and fled the country, and Filat is convicted as well to 9 years of jail, because of them, that saying, it is alive. This group is represented by Maia Sandu and Andrei Nastase. For a little while the word of a single nominee is spreading, but, as we say, the chances are weak. If, although, there will be a miracle and the single candidate will be identified, than the fight for the second place will be very tight. </p>\r\n<p>The third option is the parties from that are governing. The highest chances here has Marian Lupu. On behalf of the PD President are local Party organisations, administrative resources and the most solid media holding from the country. There is also Mihai Ghimpu who, this time, to officially declare the unification with Romania as the highest priority of the Liberals in this Presidential campaign. According to all the probabilities, in this campaign pushing on unionism will not make the difference. This is happening because of the protagonists of the message. It is also crowded on this segment: here was not identified a single candidate as well. </p>\r\n<p>There is also of course Iurie Leanca. The emanation of PLDM from the old days, the head of all ratings of premiership period, Leanca has fallen in the disgrace of the chief from back there, and after that of the others who stayed in the Party. This happened at the same time when Iurie Leanca insisted, when he still was a Prime Minister, on the Kroll's investigation over the Bank fraud. Afterwards, the former Party colleagues tried to put on Leanca's shoulders, \"a simple Prime-Minister\", how he defined himself back there, all the sins of his government. And, the most of them succeeded. With all the support that he has from the Western partners of development, Iurie Leanca does not benefit for now, in surveys, for the score that he desires.  Although, from all the candidates, the leader of PPEM seems to be the most prepared for the chair of the President. As we can see, at our voters have a better feedback from a lie than a true and coherent speech. It is extraordinary if the government realizes the danger of Dodon's vitory, from the start would take a step back and support Leanca - the exponent of the constructive opposition. Unfortunately, it was meant to be. Leanca has at least at the present time, small chances to accede in the second tour.</p>\r\n<p>Who will be the opponent of Dodon in the second round? That is the question! ... It's hard to say. Even if they decide on a single candidate, it does not mean that the supporters of Sandu will vote blindly for Nastase or vice versa. On the other hand, the PD candidate, having available an impressive arsenal of organizational, administrative and media resources, surely, will continue to increase in the voters' options. However to what extent Marian Lupu will be able to attract the votes of the followers of Maia Sandu and (or) Andrei Nastase's? Maia Sandu or Nastase, without PD electorate's votes, will get in the second round? Here I have big question marks. Many of their followers, without their own candidate, will prefer in the second round, to stay at home, and it increases the chances of Igor Dodon to win the elections.</p>\r\n<p>About the fact that in the Republic of Moldova conditions the direct election of the president is a waste of time, resources and efforts as was written before. However, as Shakespeare said, “In all evil there is a bit of good”. After a long period of time, the politics in Chisinau becomes more personalized. The score obtained by the candidates (many of whom are also party leaders) will have a direct impact on their subsequent positioning within the party. Some of them - who today are still dreaming to become presidents of the country - will have to state that the options of the voters, is not rising even at the margin of error. Normally, will come resignations of honor, if, of course, through ambition and vanity, this still is a value shared by our party leaders.</p>\r\n<p>We must admit that among those 16 registered candidates are persons of all tastes and demands of the electorate. We can not grumble that we do not have for whom to vote. You want a president who, along with the current government, to be actively involved in the implementation of the Association Agreement with the European Union? Vote for Marian Lupu, Iurie Leanca, Mihai Ghimpu and Valeriu Ghiletchi. You want scandals, shows and confrontation? Vote for Dodon, Nastase, Dumitru Ciubasenko and Maia Sandu (even if his last messages are more temperate). It is possible that after some reflections, our option would migrate to the next one in the preferences top, ranked with greater chances, so that the vote would not be lost. That would be reasonable. In addition, in the second round, many of us, as usually, we will leave ourselves in the hands of the smallest evil. </p>",

                "lead": "The debate on the single candidate of the pro-European right-wing opposition reached the homestretch; or it should be this way. The fact that both Maia Sandu as well as Andrei Nastase and Viorel Cibotaru carried out the promise and announced again the keeping of the agreement on a single candidate. It would be better for them to maintain their commitment on and on. Well, the deadlock occurred once the definitive survey has failed to make a credible difference between those two. (Furthermore: the next one might also denote the same situation). And then, it obviously returns to the political decision - also pragmatic one - of who will be able to enter the second round and win the elections.",
                "Continut": "<p>I also waited for an outcome, announced for the first days of October, because, anyway, the campaign is straight and it's late and hard to communicate the name of the common candidate, if it is still delayed. In addition, no one makes any transfer, because there's no time. Therefore, we have chosen to publish our own analysis and the clear conclusion of the <em>second best</em> fact. As if to say: <em>the second best one possible (and the best choice), the best candidate between those two, most likely, is Maia Sandu.</em></p>\r\n<p>What are the arguments? Firstly, the trends and prospects of the question of accession in round 2. Therefore, Andrei Nastase makes a transfer of votes to Maia Sandu, in the case that he withdraws from the race and supports her effectively. On the contrary, the process is, however, much lower. Maia Sandu has a special electorate, rather inclined towards rectitude, morality and ethical stubborness, which prevents any transfer to Andrei Nastase. Moreover, as Viorel Cibotaru said personally, PLDM would vote on majority for Maia Sandu, and not Andrei Nastase.</p>\r\n<p>The next argument is regarding the win in the second round in front of Dodon. Here the things are even clearer: only Maia Sandu is the single candidate, who has a chance to defeat Igor Dodon in the second round, if supported fully and strongly by Andrei Nastase. However, at the same time, she is the only one that could mainly gather the votes of other candidates. All the rest candidates cannot gather the necessary votes from the governing pro-Europeans, respectively, among the opposition. Iurie Leanca is limited electorally, so is Marian Lupu. Hence, they cannot take votes from the voters of Maia Sandu and Andrei Nastase, respectively from the opposition voters.</p>\r\n<p>Andrei Nastase drops in polls, Maia Sandu increases. In addition, although both are suitable for power because of the anti-Plahotniuc, anti-oligarch, anti-captive country statements and even actions, Nastase has no chance to take the votes of the Democratic Party or Liberal one or any figures in the current government. Nor the votes from the electorate of these parties - to a greater extent than Maia Sandu. Therefore, in the second round, gaining trust from third party voters is done mainly for Maia Sandu, not for Andrei Nastase, who has limited any possibility of growth in the final.</p>\r\n<p>Finally, another argument woul be the <strong>profile of the new president: fragile, woman, moralistic, ethical.</strong> And maybe we need such a president - a lady! - which comes to the forefront periodically to draw attention to the great issues of society. Obviously, as I said above, Maia Sandu is second best after a neutral candidate, coming from the civil society and supported by all four parties of the pro-European origin (I attached Iurie Leanca simply because his electorate is similar to the other three, respectively the other three make up the former electorate PLDM).</p>\r\n<p>It is true that Maia Sandu has her own issues: she is a woman in an excessively masculine political world, conservative; fragility an lack of eagerness may be costly in the campaign to cover the settlements of the country at least once and for the succession of events and, especially, it costs and will cost a lot more the visible association with the anarchist party, anti-system from Romania, USR, even if she visited the EPP head office to gain support, along with Viorel Cibotaru. However, <em>in any case, she is the best option today.</em></p>\r\n<p>Why NOT Andrei? Rather, due to the shaky, but clear conclusions based on the analysis of the growth dynamics, the coverage of votes and  attention, as well as his professionalism and consistency.</p>",

The power, traditionally, begins at the University, because at the University is given, traditionally, besides power (how to forget the seven rectors who entered altogether in the PLDM?), others keep going with the symbols launching their campaign in the Union Square, because they can do it (and it seems just that), others going to the people in the provinces, where they hardly have stepped when they were in ministerial functions ...",
                "Continut": "<p>However before we return to the strange stuff, let us start, gladly we have with what, with something good:</p>\r\n<p><strong>FESTIVAL FROM TRANSILVANIA IN CHISINAU</strong>, Transilvania International Film Festival initiated in Cluj-Napoca in 2002, expands <a href=\"/ro/stiri/cultura/1314/Festivalul-Interna%C8%9Bional-de-Film-Transilvania--%C3%AE%C8%99i-aduce-peliculele-la-Chi%C8%99in%C4%83u.htm\" target=\"_blank\">for the first time ever to Moldova</a>. The first edition of TIFF Chisinau will take place from 6 to 9 October 2016 at the Odeon Cinema, and will bring a selection of recent Romanian films alongside some of the most acclaimed international productions presented in Cluj. The program is beautiful, the prices are not excessively high (60 lei on iticket.md, not even two cups of coffee at a terrace  in Chisinau!), so I say we could go for it. </p>\r\n<p>Now about something good again, however with a bit of regret:</p>\r\n<p><strong>DAY OF WINE</strong> There are events that you cannot categorize easily. As the Day of Wine. Could we have a positive attitude towards an event that celebrate the alcohol? Well, it is simple: the wine can be a drink from the most noble ones when it is consumed by noble people. And vice versa. Not wine is the problem, but <a href=\"/ro/stiri/cultura/1373/FOTOREPORTAJ-Cum-se-bea-%C8%99i-se-m%C4%83n%C3%A2nc%C4%83-la-Ziuna-Na%C8%9Bional%C4%83-a-Vinului.htm\" target=\"_blank\">those who drink it</a>. In Chisinau <a href=\"/ro/stiri/social/1432/Poli%C8%9Bia-a-f%C4%83cut-bilan%C8%9Bul-dup%C4%83-Ziua-Vinului-12-%C3%AEnc%C4%83lc%C4%83ri-minore-%C8%99i-un-omor.htm\">it ended with a dead body</a>... As you know, but I would not go to this kind of holidays in Moldova.</p>\r\n<p><strong>2,2% OF GROWTH IN 2016</strong> The World Bank says that we will register a higher growth than the one estimated initially, of <a href=\"/en/news/business/1499/World-Bank-improves-the-estimation-of-Moldovan-economy's-growth-up-to-22-percent-in-2016.htm\" target=\"_blank\">exactly 2,2%</a>.  The comma impedes us to be enthusiastic, but we will notice that even this is not really our merit. I would say that we owe some to our eastern neighbor which, if we believe the same WB, will be the champions of Europe in 2016 with an <a href=\"/en/news/international/1488/IMF-Report--Romania-the-highest-economic-growth-on-the-continent-in-2016-and-2017.htm\" target=\"_blank\">economic growth of around 5%</a>. If we were \"integrated\" more, maybe ours would have been also higher ... However, this is when 30% fear the ghost of the \"Romanian gendarme\" we remain with nothing<em>. </em></p>\r\n<p><strong>550.000 FOR THE GAS PIPELINE</strong> Romania will give Moldova <a href=\"/ro/stiri/economic/1523/Bucure%C8%99tiul-ne-d%C4%83-550-mii-euro-pentru-conducta-Ungheni---Chi%C8%99in%C4%83u.htm\" target=\"_blank\">a grant of 550,000 euros</a> to develop the detailed technical design for the construction of the Ungheni-Chisinau gas pipeline. Perhaps at least now we are moving forward! Is it so damn difficult to build a pipe? Or we need to remind to whom Moldova-Gaz belongs?</p>\r\n<p><strong>A STRATEGY FOR MOLDOVA</strong> The Minister of Defense, <a href=\"/ro/stiri/politic/1326/%C3%8Ent%C3%A2lnire-%C5%9Ealaru-Iohannis-la-Cotroceni-A-%C3%AEnceput-preg%C4%83tirea-Strategiei-pentru-Republica-Moldova.htm\">Anatol Salaru, is meeting with Klaus Iohannis</a> at Cotroceni. They discussed \"the prospects of development of the bilateral cooperation levels on common interests such as<a href=\"/en/news/editorials/1332/Romania-and-USA-will-work-together-in-Moldova-West-of-Balkans-and-other-strategical-regions.htm\" target=\"_blank\"> security and defense</a>, as well as Moldova's European path\". These are good, really very good, but here this sentence caught my attention in particular: <em>\"the strategic approach, in the medium and long term, which will determine the positioning in this relationship\"</em> ... I mean, what we have to understand is that until now there has not been such a thing? ... Instead, what passionate speeches and declarations of love that has been given us to hear!</p>\r\n<p><strong>INFORMATIONAL SECURITY</strong> The Filip government authorized today the <a href=\"/ro/stiri/politic/1515/Contracararea-r%C4%83zboiului-informa%C8%9Bional-Guvernul-a-aprobat-%E2%80%9EConcep%C5%A3ia-securit%C4%83%C5%A3ii-informa%C5%A3ionale%E2%80%9D.htm\">concept of informational security</a>, where is also found the concept of \"informational war\". It should have been done a long time ago! Isn't it too late? We should move faster and more dynamic. We do not have time. At all...</p>\r\n<p><strong>CUSTOMS OFFICER TO WEEDING </strong> Twenty eight employees of the checkpoints Tudora and Palanca <a href=\"/ro/stiri/social/1328/Bilan%C8%9Bul-descinderilor-de-azi-efectuate-de-CNA-%C8%99i-PA-la-vama-noastr%C4%83-%E2%80%9Ecea-de-toate-zilele%E2%80%9D.htm\" target=\"_blank\">were detained</a> a week ago by the anti-corruption prosecutors and CNA officers, suspected of passive corruption. I would not want to give comments too early. The notion of the presumption of innocence still exists. But I must admit that I was and am still impressed.</p>\r\n<p>Now, if we have exhausted the good ones, let's move to the crazy stuff.</p>\r\n<p><strong>12 ARE LEFT</strong> <a href=\"/en/news/political/1554/They-were-enough-but-remained-thereabouts-the-ballot-paper-will-include-names-of-12-competitors.htm\" target=\"_blank\">CEC dediced: they will be only 12</a>. I would erase six more. At least I would like to be explained to me how candidates like Maia Laguta or Ana Gutu are left in the race after announcing that \"at some competitors, including Maia Laguta and Ana Gutu, the CEC<strong> found deceased people!</strong>,\" that signed \"in their support.\" And I cannot understand, how after the published investigation about funding Dodon and Ciubashenco through offshores, can the latter be left in the list. Although, here it seems that not everything is clear and we have doubts ...</p>\r\n<p><strong>WILL DODON BE IN THE RACE?</strong> Candu, while being in USA, where he <a href=\"/ro/stiri/politic/1395/Candu-a-dat-chef-la-Congresul-american-Invita%C8%9Bi-Bridget-Brink-congresmani-%C8%99i-func%C8%9Bionari-SUA.htm\" target=\"_blank\">is seen with the american <em>beau-monde</em></a> and makes fun of Nastase, publishes a statement in international media <a href=\"/en/news/political/1481/Candu-accuses-Russia-in-the-international-press-that-it's-involving-in-the-electoral-campaign-in-MD.htm\" target=\"_blank\">accusing Russia of attempts to influence elections</a> in Moldova. <a href=\"/en/news/political/1489/Marian-Lupu-Dodon-is-an-enforcer-of-a-political-project-elaborated-outside-of-Moldova.htm\" target=\"_blank\">Lupu, in Chisinau, makes also a statement</a>, but rather for internal use, electoral. This one we have not taken into account without the Candu's and without... extremely <a href=\"/en/news/political/1482/Dodon-threatens-to-mount-violent-protests-if-he-is-removed-from-the-electoral-race.htm\" target=\"_blank\">harsh reaction of Dodon</a> threatening violent protests if he is pulled out of the race. It means he knows that there are sufficient reasons to do it! But will the authorities have the courage to do this? ...</p>\r\n<p><strong>THE LOAN IS PUBLIC DEBT</strong> Being guaranteed by the state (here is where and  when the \"crime\" was committed!) the granted loan to plug the hole of the \"billion\" was converted in state debt. It was undoubtedly a precondition for signing the memorandum with the IMF. I and 99.9% of the country's citizens do not know the details of the \"transaction\" and have no idea what I am talking about. However how not to speak again about the \"government\", to stop talking once again about the \"captured state\" etc., etc.? The package passed in force by the Government was <a href=\"/en/news/political/1447/Timofti-promulgated-those-7-laws-for-which-the-Filip-Government-assumed-responsibility.htm\" target=\"_blank\">ratified by the President</a>, the motion of no confidence in the Parliament <a href=\"/en/news/political/1417/The-Motion-failed-due-to-lack-of-quorum-The-meeting-led-by-Vitiuc-lasted-one-minute.htm\" target=\"_blank\">did not happen</a>, because deputies did not come to vote, just as <a href=\"/en/news/social_en/1421/Miting-at-the-Parlament--PSRM-PPDA-PN--PLDM---reunited-after-the-Motion-failed.htm\" target=\"_blank\">did not come the demonstrators</a> called by Nastase, Usatai, Dodon &amp; Co at protest . No, my dears, to be understood correctly: I do not agree with the \"nationalization of losses\" and \"privatization of profits\" (this is how they call this work, not \"captured state\"), nor to scratch tongues in vain I would not like. I can accept the idea that at this stage and <a href=\"/ro/stiri/economic/1504/BM-Convertirea-garan%C8%9Biilor-%C3%AEn-datorie-de-stat-unicul-pas-logic-al-deciziilor-luate-de-Guvern.htm\" target=\"_blank\">there was no other solution</a>, even if totally disagree with it ...</p>\r\n<p><strong>MILK ON THE MINISTER</strong> I cannot accept this kind of protest, a <a href=\"/en/news/social_en/1353/Armasu-the-victim-of-a-hooligan-gesture-Donica-spilled-a-bucket-with-milk-on-his-head.htm\" target=\"_blank\">staged violence</a>. In the government there are not a lot of ministers that would come to work on foot. Let's just wait this one, with camera ready, to humiliate him ... It's something vile and disgusting in this act. And something that occurred irreparably ... Someone who cuts with insistence and poisons the last oases of normality that remain in this country. Soon all of them will walk with bulletproof umbrellas. And we will grumble and curse them for this. The aggressor <a href=\"/ro/stiri/social/1363/FLASH--Donic%C4%83-agresorul-ministrului-Arma%C8%99u-a-fost-re%C8%9Binut.htm\" target=\"_blank\">was arrested</a>. And I do not feel any compassion for him.</p>\r\n<p><strong>THE SELF-DENOUNCE OF USATAI</strong> Renato <a href=\"/ro/stiri/politic/1448/VIDEO--Usat%C3%AEi-a-publicat-o-interceptare-%C3%AEn-care-ar-ap%C4%83rea-vocea-lui-Plahotniuc.htm\">publishes a fragment from phone conversation</a> where is heard the voice of Plahotniuc and accuses him of trying to hush up the case. Only the other's voice is of Usatai himself! And it might be that the one whose posterior burns is even Usatai. And if you sit and think, even (please pardon the) words of Plaha \"burn the ass\" do not mean that he no longer controls everything right? ... That he is a \"man with ties\" everyone knows. But who is not there among them? If you want, read what  Grigoriev says.</p>\r\n<p><strong>THE INTERVIEW OF GRIGORIEV </strong>The interview is simply fabulous! <a href=\"/ro/stiri/politic/1457/INTERVIU--Igor-Grigoriev-Shor-mi-a-recunoscut-c%C4%83-l-a-finan%C5%A3at-pe-Dodon-%C3%AEmpreun%C4%83-cu-Platon.htm\" target=\"_blank\">I strongly recommend to read it</a>! Shor and Dodon and his reactions make me believe that what Grigoriev says is not false. We learn from the interview that Platon, Dodon, Shor, Melnik, Balitchi, Voronin, all are from the same gang... And for those who like the theory of \"captured state\" there is a fragment about the godfather Voronin there. Instructive!</p>\r\n<p>That's all. There may have been others. However, the news that most expect did not come in the past week.</p>",

                "lead": "Why the geopolitics? Because it is the determining factor that marks since beginning the politics as well as the politics in Moldova. It would be great if the current election campaign themes, but also of the previous ones aimed only the everyday problems. However if you analyze the essence of our problems, you realize that the geopolitics is ubiquitous. If not directly, then indirectly to the country project, which we aim to implement. Geopolitics is not just to have access where it is easier to sell your apples or your wine, although that is geopolitics as well; Geopolitics is not just where the \"gasses are getting out\". For us, the geopolitics in the campaign means development models. We want to work disgusted and steal as in the East do, however to live as in the West. I think that decades of Soviet power and 25 years of independence shows us that this is impossible.",
                "Continut": "<p>Now, the billion theft problem is rightfully exploited to the maximum. It happened during the governments that have declared themselves pro-European. Nevertheless, if you follow the thread where they hatched the schemes and by whom were they inspired and applied, you realize that they lead more towards east. Were they not designed and implemented by exploiting the greed and callousness of local politicians to compromise the European path, with which they identified themselves? Therefore, it is at least not serious to ignore the geopolitical factor when you are talking about the election situation in Moldova. </p>\r\n<p>For a while, some political forces in Chisinau were going on the message \"and-and\", ie: and the EU, and Russia. That was possible only if the partner in the East wanted a rapprochement with Europe. In the early 90s, once it seemed feasible prospect, but after installing the Putin regime in Moscow, this has become impossible. As Vladimir Putin grows more durable roots in Kremlin, Russia was breaking away from Europe and Western values. That made practically impossible to play in two skiffs stay once they went into different parts or \"sucking\" from two cows, as some would say. At present, relations between Europe and Russia are such that the issue is only \"or-or\".</p>\r\n<p>Russian world is a world of which we cannot yet break. I do not think that is in our power to do it by ourselves. Directly and forcibly, we are connected to it, with small intervals, for over two hundred years. Unlike the Western social-economic and political model that provides welfare and liberty, the Russian world in addition to his own ambitions of domination, was not noted by anything. The Russian world - a place where the company has not experienced political modernization. Here the state has maintained its quasi-total control over the society, but in outside, it tried to secure dominance by extensive methods. Without offering a dynamic and viable model, Russia passes today by a stage of deep and dangerous agonies. Trying desperately to keep its previous position, unable to offer to others something tangible and real that it prefers a world of confrontation not competition.</p>\r\n<p>Over us crosses the line that separates the Russian world of the western one. These two spaces, in fact, offer two different pictures of the world. One based on force expansionism, another on the competition. One, leading after the written law, another one after unwritten ones. A model that has tested welfare and freedom, and another, underdevelopment and authoritarianism. Essentially, the October 30, 2016 presidential race is a choice between these two models. Thus, in a form more or less open or covert, the geopolitics are present in the programs of the two forces, which marks electoral debates: the Russian match and the European match. We can also talk and about intermediate variants, about some mutants, but with the same objectives.</p>\r\n<p>The Russian match in Moldova is represented traditionally by parties and persons that are placed on the left side of the political spectrum, and, more recently, populists without ideology, without a program and without any unscrupulous (and even without pants! ...). They are fishing among nostalgic voters, ethnic minorities, families whose inhabiting incomes depend on remittances from the East, but also of people disappointed by how things work in the country. The lamentable performance of governments that have identified themselves as pro-European electoral have strengthened the pro-Russian segment.</p>\r\n<p>The support for the campaign in various forms and means also comes from the East. Firstly, through the pro-Russian propaganda, which is available through national frequencies, is called a massive audience from our localities. To Russian channels are added the local ones. Through unilateral criticism by the representatives of the current government, which, with the support, but under strict monitoring of the Westerners, is concerned with the implementation of the Association Agreement actually draws water to the mill of the Russian game. On this dimension activates an army of journalists, analysts, commentators, bloggers. Some of them declare their geopolitical options openly, others do it discreetly. Paradoxical as it may seem, the last mentioned are working in projects focused on promoting Western values, so the geopolitical twist, just to make us ti renounce to geopolitics. Among them there are also people connected to rival lobbyists of those in government today. They probably are hopping that by changing the vector, some will make it up, and the others will succeed to escape jail so that the old projects can be revived. Now, they are uncompromising with the current government and indulgent with those put under accusation. If you watch carefully, they are working in prestigious institutions connected to projects promoting democratic values and principles: rule of law, pluralism, freedom, transparency etc. The Litmus test to identify them is their attitude towards early elections, which would install at the ruling the Russian game.</p>\r\n<p>Another stand-premise to the Russian match remains the paternalistic mentality of most citizens, ready to go into the hands of some adventurers that are offering easy solutions in the form of promises to reconnect the country to \"paradise\" in the East. Judging by the polls, many people believe them. Given the increasingly bad image of Russia in the world, due to its actions in the international arena, but also within the country, the representatives of the parties find it increasingly difficult to remain persuasive and relevant. That is why they prefer a less initiated public, unhappy and manipulated by Russian propaganda. The nominees from the pro Russian game declare that, if they become president, they will dissolve parliament and early elections will result. They want this as quickly as they can, as long they are still on the top. How they manage to provoke early elections, by remaining within the constitutional framework, of course, they won't say. Or, as we know, the powers of the President are limited, the Parliament can not be dissolved only by the whim of someone, even if it is the President, whose election program is the promise in question. But as it turns out,  that does not matter neither for the candidates or for their electorate. Destructive instinct prevails over reason and constructive intentions.</p>\r\n<p>In the current Russian game, declared candidates at the presidential elections are just a few. The most likely suitor is the PSRM leader, Igor Dodon. Next is the PN candidate, Dumitru Ciubasenco and that's about it. The Grand absent is the candidate from the Communist Party. Note that, accidentally or not, this election is not a too crowded segment. Aside from a few independent candidates, who are exploiting the populist message, we do not have anyone. This fact opens the corridor that leads the representative of this party to the second round (which, according to polls, with a difference of score will be Igor Dodon).</p>\r\n<p>The Russian party still has candidates among the populist ones, although some declare themselves from the right wing, that in qualification for the stereotype of the domestic political discourse, means pro-European. Here firstly is highlighted Andrei Nastase, the leader of the DA Platform, now the party of the same name. Exponent of some forces with oligarchic intentions, whose main objective is to accede to power at any cost. In the effort to gather votes from both geopolitical parties, it urges to disregard the vector of development of the country. Like the candidates who are openly pro-Russian and campaign for early elections, and sees the president position sees as a lever to destabilize the situation in the country. By striving to provoke early parliamentary elections, Nastase is not even scared of the possibility that the Russian party from Moldovan politics would seize a political majority. Now is left to answer how pro-European is the \"right-wing\" candidate - Andrei Nastase.</p>\r\n<p>Other populists who can take the votes of the electorate from this segment are independent candidates - Inna Popenco, Maia Laguta, but here no one expects surprises.</p>\r\n<p>I would like to think that Maia Sandu, when was insisting on early elections or trying to convince the IMF not to sign the Memorandum with Moldova, due to emotions of the moment, without taking into account the geopolitical aspects i.e. long-term effects of installing a game of the Russian power.</p>\r\n<p>The totality of objective and subjective factors make the Russian match persistent and vivid in this space,  and from geopolitics - a subject still omnipresent and unavoidable in the local political speech.</p>",

                "lead": "Last week in Chisinau were held several events. On this occasion, I had the pleasant surprise to see that the Information Security Concept of Moldova was launched and approved by the Government. A fact which I applaud, as an unusual gesture, because a document regarding the information security has not been approved yet by Romania either, even if it applies the National Defense Strategy since July 2015, which states these elements of threats, risks and vulnerabilities; and the responsible institutions who applies it, in fact, for years. When I got to read with a pencil, the document in question, I found very good things and less good things, and unfortunately, a number of major confusions that must be remedied. However, I must welcome this step.",
                "Continut": "<p>Good things are obvious: an extremely well-balanced structure of the Concept - describing the situation and problem definition, fundamental concepts (definitions), the purpose and objectives of the Concept, as a document, policy documents and relevant papers, tools and approaches to solve the problem, institutional system and its objectives, assurance of information security and ways to achieve this, international co-operation on the matter, the organization of the responsible institutional system, impact evaluation, threats and sources of threats to national security information line.</p>\r\n<p>Another positive sensible element is the construction of a hierarchy of the rigors that develop the Barry Buzan's concept of security and European Security School in Copenhagen, which place the secured elements on three levels: the citizen, the society and the state. Furthermore, the proposed hierarchy by the document places (in the alternative, it is true), more symbolically, the <strong>citizen in the foreground</strong>, a deeply liberal approach, and the rights of citizens, its interests, of the society and of the state - between the defended components of the responsible institutions. Once again, a modern approach, liberal, with the citizen in the forefront of the security approaches.</p>\r\n<p>There are also elements that betray the <strong>authors confusion</strong> and lack of some legislation helping elements, discovered along the way and suddenly introduced in the same document which came very dense, confusing, frequently unclear and highly bureaucratic, sometimes even verging on <em>drunkenness words</em>. In terms of legislative technique, even in matters of strategic documents with political relevancy, as it should be, the Concept is - to repeat myself - <em>an unclear document, confusing, bushy and without a view</em>. So, <em>without being intelligible to the authors themselves, let alone for the responsible institutions, not to mention the population.</em></p>\r\n<p>Thus, the <strong>main confusion</strong> that is made throughout the document is between <strong>information, cybernetic and informational</strong>. The confusion is at times major, even if, in the Concept contents, the elements of all these notions. However, after reading the document, except for a number of general provisions that can refer to the informational security, and two or three specific mentions of this - including the reference to psychological operations - the document seems to be rather a <strong>strategy of Cyber Security</strong> than one of information security, although in some ways seems to encompass concerns and elements of the previous one.</p>\r\n<p>Let us be clear: <strong>cyber security</strong> concerns cyberspace, <strong>computer objects</strong>, and in the <strong>virtual space</strong> it just concerns the aggressive action towards the components of a computer system - computers, networking, communications - that attacks, compromises or extracts <strong>data</strong>. Nothing to do with <strong>informational security</strong>, one that refers to the information space, which has to do with public information, with media, with the internet and social networks for the purposes of their use for psychological operations, trolls wars, recruitment operations and conditioning in cyberspace, propaganda, misinformation, active measures in the public space, including virtual and internet, lobby operations for achieving those listed above. <em>So, for a concept of informational security, people have to wait, Moldova was not the champion to combat such kind of bullying!</em></p>\r\n<p>Why do I say this is confusion? The two plans merge, overlap, there are elements of informational security, mixed through the document that concerns in fact the cyber security. The cyberspace is an environment of conducting an informational warfare, so the informational security must be ensured in this space as well, so it has to do with the cyber security, physical elements of Communications and Information. However, the remaining elements of public space are aiming regulations and instruments that have to do inclusively with content from this virtual space as one from the public space, media, virtual or not.</p>\r\n<p>And then I was saying that there are lacking certain support laws, which transpires in the complication and mixing of the provisions in the current concept: the law on free access to public information, the law of free access to classified information, personal data protection, in the first place. <em>A complete rationalization of the concept is absolutely necessary to communicate clearly with the people want do we want and to be understood! </em>Otherwise the document is useless, it is checked a point or a necessity requested by the EU in the Association Agreement and that's it.</p>\r\n<p>Neither on the scale of <strong>cyber security</strong> the things are not simple, there does not exist at least the separation of <strong>hardware</strong> and <strong>software</strong>; nor any reference to <strong>software</strong>, <strong>licenses</strong> or <strong>royalties</strong>, to <strong>antivirus programs</strong> and proper use of computers, of each terminal connected to the <strong>Internet</strong>. Since we started with the notions, the highlighted in the text by us (and many of those that are there), with unclear definitions and often unnecessary, could be missing: less damage.</p>\r\n<p>Otherwise, a salutary document: through will and desire, with the courtesy to adopt it in a theoretical framework approach and from a welcomed angle of understanding of security, but - I repeat - with many things redone, cerebrated, rewritten (fundamentally!). Launch the application and we will come to help, as we did with other documents in the area of the Republic of Moldova.</p>",

                "lead": "These days we have witnessed an event long awaited by some, less by others, but everyone commented with eagerness. After long discussions, pressures and intrigues, on Saturday, September 15, 2016, was played a political wedding, how we did not see and hear for a long time in these parts. The PPDA leader, Andrei Nastase, and the leader of PAS, Maia Sandu swore unity and faith in the presidential elections of October 30, 2016 in front of followers, and also cameras. Although we knew about this day, before the event took place officially in the native village of Andrei Nastase: a small consolation needed by PPDA leader, because not him, but Maia Sandu is the single candidate.",
                "Continut": "<p>As it is natural, a political alliance is one of interest and less love. <em>The great absenties of the ceremony were the political parents of the protagonists.</em> Some are abroad (but not at work, of course!), others here in the country, but all the parts - a common trait that probably unites - with sentences issued by the courts ... </p>\r\n<p>Rock solid marriage ... pardon me: State solid marriage! - Wished to the new political couple close friends in the hope that it will find a place for them in this building. However, as happens in such cases, not everyone involved in this did not love the prenuptial contract provisions. Some statements reveal frustrations from Andrei Nastase's supporters. Anyway, where has been seen in this lands such a large event without comments and unsatisfied people? ... We can only wish to this tandem, fresh formed, a honeymoon equal to their love that we've seen they carry for each other ...</p>\r\n<p>The designation of PAS leader, Maia Sandu, as single candidate of the three parties changes the balance of power between candidates. As promised, the PPDA leader, Andrei Nastase will remove his name from the lists. Probably, most of his followers will vote in the first round, Maia Sandu, the rest - for one of the other populists. However, will that be enough for accession to the second round? Hard to say. A very little time is left before the elections. It depends on the message and the performance of the candidate, but also on the mobilization of the staff. In the second round - if, of course, manages to get there - Maia Sandu is credited with big chances in front of Igor Dodon. If she will manage to come up with a moderate and constructive message, then she could count on the votes of Iurie Leanca's followers, as well as much of Marian Lupu's voters. The votes of the Unionist candidates, but also of some independent nominees, in the second tour, also can migrate to the of PAS leader. Therefore, <em>Maia Sandu has good chances to win the second round</em>.</p>\r\n<p>Marian Lupu is the candidate who continues to rise the most in polls. If things will continue like this (and we see that PD is seriously addressing to this campaign), then Lupu is likely to pass into the second round. In this case, the fate of the election will be determined in large part by PD leader's score in the first round. In the final showdown, Marian Lupu will be able to count on PPEM votes, the votes of unionists, the votes of Maia Sandu followers and the voters of independent candidates Valeriu Ghileţchi and Silvia Radu.</p>\r\n<p>It is hard to say about the Platform ones. It is obvious that their leader, Andrei Nastase, would prefer as President the Socialist Dodon rather than Marian Lupu. The attempt to remove the geopolitical factor in electoral competition betrays Nastase's intention to urge followers to vote in favor of Dodon, in the case that in the second round will not accede Maia Sandu, but Marian Lupu. Perhaps some of his followers would follow the urging, but there will also be those who, if they decide to go to the polls, so they will not opt for Marian Lupu as against Igor Dodon, i.e. they will vote geopolitical.</p>\r\n<p>For now it is certainly risky to pronounce ourselves on the second candidate who will pass the second round. The situation can change from day to day. We still cannot know what will be the impact of PDAA, PAS and PLDM decision to go with a single candidate. The sociological measurement results will come later, only around elections. If we are guided by the realities of the day, we can say that Marian Lupu has best chances in the first round and Maia Sandu in the second round.</p>\r\n<p>Iurie Leanca is the candidate who deserves perhaps the most to be President. I refer to the competence, experience, support of which he has from the Western partners. That in the case the politics would be a competition where wins the best. We must recognize that Iurie Leanca and PPEM has mismanaged the good image and high ratings that the former prime minister had two years ago. At the beginning, we see him in intransigent opposition, along with those who dug the pit for him. Then - presumably at the urge of Western partners - we see him as well in opposition, but this time in a constructive one. Iurie Leanca's chances would have been much higher in this election if he was the unique candidate of government and constructive opposition. I think this was the chance of the current government to win without great emotions before the socialist leader.</p>\r\n<p>Now there is pressure on the PPEM leader to yield in favor of Sandu Maia. To this purpose it is resorting to the authority of the European People President, Joseph Daul. Iurie Leanca's response leaves no room for interpretation: \"I keep running for Moldova's presidency ... . The right wing candidates remained in the presidential race still have much to learn in order to lead the country.\" It is interesting to track the relation of Iurie Leanca and Maia Sandu, over recent years, with PLDM - the party which launched them in big politics. When he was in government, both of them were part of the PLDM team. Then both Leanca and Sandu, have formed their own parties. The PLDM remains, the whole band of supporters of the Greens (journalists, analysts, commentators, NGO's) are supporting hardly Maia Sandu and blames the former Liberal-Democrat Prime-Minister everywhere. That Iurie Leanca who, two years ago, was the chief of all ratings and the locomotive of PLDM in the last parliamentary elections. I'm wondering why?</p>\r\n<p>The explanation is simple: Vlad Filat could not forgive Iurie Leanca for invitation of the Kroll company to investigate the banking theft. Heavy cases and arrests followed. Those left in the PLDM felt on themselves what it's like to manage a party without money coming from somewhere outside of the party. Instead, Maia Sandu's PAS site has enjoyed the full support of the former leader of the PLDM. At the time, the former Minister of Education benefited from a qualified advisory support offered by experts made available to the Government of Moldova from the development partners, since he was part of the government, and then as leader of PAS. Former president of the PLDM, Vlad Filat, saw in PAS's creation a satellite project in case the PLDM affairs will not go so well. That happened later. Now everything depends on how much Maia Sandu is independent of former Party chief and allies of the moment, the opponents of Vladimir Plahotniuc clans in the country and abroad. That's actually the question.</p>\r\n<p>The most ferocious supporters of pro-European vector are unionists. Inspired by the data of surveys before the election, and relying on their intuition, the Liberals, led by their leader Mihai Ghimpu decided that in this campaign to go open with the unionist message. As did Ana Gutu and the leader \"Right\" of  Party. Although the surveys, even the most pessimistic ones, are indicating a large segment of union followers among citizens, this message is not transferred to the protagonists. Perhaps the union will have to wait for other campaigns and other players ...</p>\r\n<p>Being focused on candidates that are credited with chances, we overlook the independent pnes. And it's a shame. Among independent candidates are met all the qualities of a head of state prerogatives within the limits stipulated by the Constitution. If in this campaign were not 12, but only two candidates - Valeriu Ghileţchi and Silvia Radu - we could say that we have a choice. Valeriu Ghileţchii, being in our politics for years, he managed to establish itself as a true politician: honest, upright and competent. The big surprise is Silvia Radu, who breathes new life into communication with citizens, but also in addressing public policy.</p>\r\n<p>They are the candidates and parties in the current presidential elections, if analyzed from the perspective of geopolitics. There are only two weeks. This two weeks will be decisive. Even if the role and the place of President of the Republic of Moldova in the political system is modest, we see that the players stakes are, however, great. It is important that the main protagonists of election, who are gripped by competition fever and the risk, to remain in a correct and civilized communication. Because, in the end, when things will settle down, it is possible that someone, perhaps even the winner, to realize that, in fact, is not convinced that this is what he wanted and what he needs most. Therefore, even in politics it is better to leave room for \"Hello\". Especially if you're sure you're part of the same geopolitical game.</p>",

                "lead": "After general sustained efforts, about five months later than it would have been really helpful to have an assured victory, the pro-European opposition of the right wing managed, finally, to nominate a single candidate. It is true that on the road have gone four parties, in March-April, with PPEM included in the group; it is true that the best option would have been the alliance with civil society and even a candidate that is outside of the parties. But we do not judge anymore today in these terms: we take the present reality and we look at developments and chances of success.",
                "Continut": "<p>It is Obviously that <em>it's a very late nomination</em>. And the delay is causing difficulties in public communication of this major change - the existence of the single candidate - until the last hamlet. Or this is the big bet of the group of three parties: <em>to inform the public of the fact that there is a single candidate</em>. And he must reach as many places as he can along with his supporters, in Moldova, at least in the big cities and in the surrounding villages, certainly in Gagauzia and Taraclia. And, meanwhile, <em>to have a component of media force</em> on which to make a communication of full actions and opinions of the program and the prospects of the new candidate.</p>\r\n<p>Igor Dodon is further anticipated with the first chance. It is natural. He's an old candidate, he has as supporter the largest party and resources which we learn, from the revelations of former comrades and heads of the campaign, that they come from foreign donors in the East, whose interests they defend. And he began to overturn his position, to avoid frightening the voters, especially since the substantial majority are pro-European. However, Dodon must be stopped - and perhaps this is the effort and message for the second round. Now the new single candidate must be promoted, decently, but with strength and visibility as a reformist and a knower of the system from the inside, so weighted by facts. Not revolutionary, not challenging the system, not anti-state and anti-system (and I'm not referring at all to the Plahotniuc system, the \"trading company\" stat, the lubrication of the gears with unintended money who have perverted everything and will create difficulties in the future; this system must be removed, of course).</p>\r\n<p>The story of early elections, imposed by Andrei Nastase remains as a loser stone, because early elections are not feasible in the context of Moldova and of the existing stable majority. More: it is the duty of the President to decide early elections but constitutionally, the inability to pass through Parliament two successive governments. Perhaps this would be the most decent exit for Maia Sandu: to argue that, as soon as the Government will fall, after what two new attempts will prove to be unsuccessful in the Parliament, will immediately convene early elections. </p>\r\n<p>So we have single candidate. How do we proceed? How relevant is this?</p>\r\n<p>All the opinion polls, more accurate or more approximate, with or without sociologists, all of them recorded the perspective of polarization of the votes on the two candidates, Igor Dodon - the left pro-Russian wing, pro-Eurasian union, pro-federalism Dniester, destructive for the state and anti-Romanian substance, a Moldovan backward-looking attitude (maybe he should ask his children who have learned at a Romanian school how and why), and Maia Sandu - the pro-European opposition reformist candidate, moralist, lady (and not in the last row!), a human of principle and a connoisseur of the system from the inside, former minister and critic, once again, <em>from within</em> the Government of which she was part of.</p>\r\n<p>According to the theory of useful vote, profiling in the foreground of the two candidates, separated today by 6, 8, ok, 10 percents, but far ahead of the following platoon, rises to polarization and elimination from the race of fringe candidates. Why would anyone vote in the first round with a sure loser, with 1, 3 or 5, or even 10 percents, when those two will enter and will fight in the second round? Of rebelliousness, of protest, of friendship or respect to a candidate or party they belong. However, it's a blatant futility.</p>\r\n<p><em>The first defeated by the need of useful vote will be Iurie Leanca.</em> After he took the blessing from Mrs. Merkel, just as he would have been taken, he received a slap on the PPE line - where Viorel Cibotaru and Maia Sandu were received by Joseph Daul, the same who welcomed Nastase's withdrawn <strong>(which either we are not shy to appreciate for the gesture and hopefully he will continue to genuinely support the single candidate as serious as he can be, from all of his resources)</strong> and demanded Iurie Leanca's withdrawal from the race. I think at this point, going forward in the campaign is politically suicidal for Leanca, who is already marked by penalties within his party for migrating somewhere in the middle, between power and opposition, for treason and collaborationism. <em>If he stays in the race, Leanca is sentenced to a tiny score</em>, and the electorate will naturally migrate to the single candidate of the right wing, even through the compatibility with former PLDM basin, found today behind Maia Sandu.</p>\r\n<p>The next natural target for the current situation will be in the order, Marian Lupu and, to a lesser extent (because it is below of his own party and under the margin of error, as tendency to vote) Mihai Ghimpu. I understand the obligation of their candidacy, but beyond the administrative and media resources, institutional and party (in the case of PDM), the chance of losing important percent in the theory of useful vote is obvious. <em>Marian Lupu has lost the aplomb and sense of growth towards the party percentages and will disappear after the first survey in which he will be exceeded by Maia Sandu with more than 10 percent</em>.</p>\r\n<p>In fact, and the presented survey to separate out the right wing candidates has revealed unequivocally and without appeal, the loss of some tenths in the context of the entry into struggle of single candidate Maia Sandu. But it is clear that the purpose of these two weeks is not, in any case, the battle with Marian Lupu and Mihai Ghimpu, not even close to that (such a process would potency them), but the self-promotion and subsequently combating Dodon in the second round.<em> The votes will move naturally in the measure of a clear pro-European orientation and the lack of explicit vindictive impulses will define the unique positioning of the right wing candidate.</em> Challenging of the methods, of the system, not for direction or started reforms - it would be the right approach; and maybe it would not hurt even in the second round, at least a meeting and a discussion with Prime Minister Filip on topics related to the situation of reforms. It would also allow the signal of a already position placing, a responsible take-over of an existing situation, not without criticism and alternatives solutions, but for sure with the support of pro-Western orientation.</p>",

                "Continut": "<p align=\"right\"><em>\"And here we are, for nearly twenty years: some, the few ones, however undisturbed by qualms, with a future bought on the beaches of Bahamas, and others, a lot of them dreaming of a more or less human existing...</em></p>\r\n<p align=\"right\"><em>A pessimist ending, no?</em></p>\r\n<p align=\"right\"><em>Pessimist<em>,</em> <em>as long as those oppressed will not understand they have the weapon in hands because the current junta: the ballot is already shaking in fear of this weapon!</em></em>”</p>\r\n<p align=\"right\">Aureliu Busuioc, <em>\"In search of time loss,\"</em> 2011, p.120</p>\r\n<p>Less than two weeks remain until the first round of presidential elections in Moldova. Never since there is this page and I have the privilege to address an audience, maybe a not sufficiently numerous one, but I hope selective (who else has the patience to read it?), I did not have the nerve to come up with recommendations or to call openly to vote for a particular candidate or a certain party. I mean just the first round, of course, and parliamentary elections.</p>\r\n<p>However, every time I insisted and I called to vote! The author of these lines is part of the generation that really dreamed of democracy. I dreamed that we can choose freely, in conscious of cause, the power to govern us. This teenage dream was transformed, paradoxically, in a kind of faith. I say paradoxical because of what we hoped for was something new, and those who have taken full advantage of the so-called \"transition\" do not cease to repeat that the fault of the today's status quo is namely the \"democracy\" ... Those who were elected democratically by some inexperienced and euphoric voters do not want to go and try to convince us that the dice are thrown and there was no point to \"bother\" them useless. Perhaps this is why is digging so zealously at the foundation of this building, that is so fragile already, because they are perfectly aware that only some genuine and healthy democratic processes can dethrone them.</p>\r\n<p>However, are we not already convinced? It is becoming increasingly difficult, and not only in the East, to defend the democratic values. \"If the elections could really change something, they would have been banned long ago\" Who does not know this wheeze? And many others ... \"They're all the same\" it is another finding, with a smell of sentence, that you can hear everywhere... The latter argument would be quite easy to remove; it is enough to look more closely at the characters that launch themselves in the electoral campaign. In particular to those who fail to be elected. Even here, did not attempt a Branzan or a Brega (to mention not only them) to gather signatures to be able to formally register his candidacy? We can of course blame the impermeable \"system\", but the fact remains fact: with all the calls made, they failed to collect the necessary signatures. Whose fault is that? Theirs? Ours? Or the \"system's\"? And when we choose leaders whom we choose, is the fault of \"democracy\"?</p>\r\n<p>In the fact that we deceive ourselves with vain promises is just the fault of the one who lies or is the fault of the believer as well? Nor can we complain of lack of information today ... The liar, certainty remains a liar and does not wash anyone's sins, but he lies just as long as we are able to believe. We can say that the politician is, without being too much wrong, a two-faced slut, but the limits of his hypocrisy are set by us. He is not a rogue and a thief only if and to the extent that he feels that he can be. Every time when we say that the politician it's a rogue, we should realize that we are talking about ourselves. In other words - every nation deserves their government ... Another cliche, isn't it?</p>\r\n<p>What could be more comfortable for a good bolted power than a massive absenteeism? Don't you think? Did you see the last parliamentary elections in Russia: only 47% percent of voters went to the polls... You know the results: even those few MPs who opposed to the regime disappeared from \"State Duma\"... And the films which were exposing how were filled the ballot boxes in Russia were again in the tops on YouTube. And now, you think about it: when it is easier to falsify the election, when polling stations are empty or when is voting massively?</p>\r\n<p>Today's omnipresent phrase is: \"captured state\". It is easy to understand that the politicians and scribes that uses the \"journalists\" (I cannot put quotation marks here) who they have in their pockets. However, the plague has entered everywhere. Even saint people throw the phrase: \"captured state\" to right and left without meaning. Only if you sit and think about it, this state has never been less \"captured\" than now! I cannot forget how in the times of daddy Voronin, even a guard at City Hall was hired only if he was a member of PCRM. Or let us remember the assault on Antena C with Euro TV? Or another example that I have not talked about it so far: in a village in the southern side of the country, a city hall received an extremely worrying alert from a veterinarian. A cow died. There was sufficient evidence that could be anthrax ...! Do you realize what this means? ... The mayor had only one interurban phone, but he was categorically forbidden to call aside from party stuff. Given the gravity of the situation, the mayor violated the \"rule\" and began to call relevant authorities in Chisinau. To his misfortune, just then he was called from the \"center\" (the party). The phone was busy. Let me tell you what happened, or not? ... What anthrax?! The Party was more important! (And Anthrax? To complete the anecdote, the mayor finally did what he thought is better to do. Alone. And it went well. But perhaps it never was anthrax...)</p>\r\n<p>Do we still talk about \"captured state\"? But we like to think that this is it, to do nothing, to grumble and fall prey to all kinds of rogue. I.e. we behave exactly as expected and that some \"captured\" fellows, convinced from the start that everything is set in stone, everything is decided elsewhere. I could say also \"slaves\" but this notion has somehow lost from the semantics weight, as well as the phrase \"principles and values\", by the way. Here's a recent example: Gofman makes some startling statements to a television channel.The Prosecution Office calls him to testify. Did Gofman went to the Prosecution Office or not? What have we got, apart from speculations and lamentations about \"captured state\"?</p>\r\n<p>We are the State and as few \"captured\" citizens are there, the less he is \"captured\" as well. And we should behave like free citizens! Do not pay where we must not pay, to defend our rights in court, ask for official explanations, to impose the respect of the law by all ... to submit, elementary, complaints and testimonies to the Prosecution Office. Even though we are aware that often it creaks and does not work. Even if the efforts we are making are triple from what it should be, it's just hard at the beginning, when the most of people are law-abiding, the politician has no choice ... Someone has to start to break this downward spiral! Or maybe it's easier as it is? Come on, honest, isn't it easier?</p>\r\n<p>The elections and the voting act are part of exactly the same paradigm. Yes, it's much easier and more comfortable to say \"everything is decided beforehand\" and ... do not go to vote, watching the debate on politician's television whom you support and chewing your gallbladder, yet again. Don't worry, that television will prove that you are right to watch them, that the state is \"captured\" and everything is decided from the start. And what do we gain from this? Or, rather, who stands to gain from this?</p>\r\n<p>There is another argument often invoked, which is brought by those who promotes absenteeism: \"As if my vote would change anything ...\" It's probably the hardest epidemic to combat. In the era of a (fake!) acerbic individualism, when absolutely everything is done to \"showcase\" the consumer's egocentricity, excuse me, the citizen's, I mean the voter's; when each of them are counting their likes and shares on social networks sites; where everywhere you are told \"You are important! You decide what and when to buy\" it becomes very difficult to realize and to accept that your vote is just one of millions ... The virtue of democracy is the collective expression in which the individual is diluted in the mass. And the value of each vote is similar to the value of another fledged citizen who does not gather hundreds of thousands of likes on Facebook or re-posts on Twitter... Even more complicated is when the \"your\" candidate does not come out in the second round. How to vote for another candidate? ... Especially when you come out of a campaign in which you learn to hate them all, apart from yours? It is not easy to go on the streets and try to overthrow an \"illegitimate\" power (because you, the man who believes that he is important, you did not voted for it)? ... And where we get? What if, once we are in the street, we encounter another band of protesters fighting for another \"illegitimacy\"?</p>\r\n<p>Yes, my dears, as difficult as it would be to accept, democracy is nothing else but a social contract (the only one valid!) that involves humility (recognizing the value of its own vote) and tolerance towards a majority, that it is likely, have not voted the same way. And, last but not least, the individual and collective responsibility. Because democracy does not really work unless the vast majority of citizens are voting.</p>\r\n<p>It is sad to note what was worn, year after year, government after government, our confidence in democracy. The political elites have managed, in time, to weaken those three pillars that keep a solid democratic system: the electoral process itself, access to information and the education.</p>\r\n<p>However, to give up today the right to vote, to refuse to vote (even in current conditions and whatever of  each's motive), is an abdication. And an active participation in what is called today \"captured state\".</p>\r\n<p style=\"text-align: left;\">I for one will vote. Each and every time when I will have the opportunity. Even if I remain the last to still do it... At least to have the moral right to say that the elected ones do not fulfill their given mandate.</p>",

                "lead": "I watched carefully the launching of the campaign, its serious side. Except the polls (and the visible controversies related to the withdrawal of Andrei Nastase), the only relevant move - in this campaign that begins to stagnate - is undoubtedly, the common launching of the candidate Maia Sandu. At least in Chisinau, if not in other communities. Even if, as I already said, the gesture is a belated one, unconvincing and still ambiguous.",
                "Continut": "<p>Last week, the campaign brought us in series: the interview of Vladimir Plahotniuc elements related to governmental activity with electoral relevance, the Gorbuntsov episode - an incident clearly announcing the self-imposed exile of Balti mayor to avoid the deserved arrest for involvement in acts of organized crime. Over all, the only important point and notable one with direct relevance for the campaign, stays the promise of several candidates, if not the threat of a future arrest of one or another candidate or political actors. Alternatively, we have a more nuanced variant linked to the assignation of a prosecutor general to carry out such arrests.</p>\r\n<p>Here, it is worth making the necessary enlightening observations. Thus, the democracy, the Europeanism and the rules of the constitutional state involve strict instruments, respect for the Constitution and the laws of country and, especially, the strict tracking of procedures and rules of the game inclusively, or firstly the separation of powers in the state. Therefore, the above allegations are shocking and moving things toward an artificial voluntarism and ignorance presumption of the democratic rules by the ones who prefer to collect votes by such promises. </p>\r\n<p>Indeed, a President always follows the constitutional provisions, which sets strictly the limits of his movements and duties. Anything that is beyond this status is deserving condemnation. Therefore, a Democratic president should avoid in his promises such elements that refer to duties that do not belong to him or that are part of a completely different state power, justice.</p>\r\n<p>It's why I decided to exclude the promise of organizing early elections simply because a president cannot determine such a process. Furthermore, it is unrealistic to promise something like this when it is a long-term perspective, moreover, almost impossible in a country with a <em>stable</em> majority and a stable government. Early elections according to the Constitution of the Republic of Moldova can only be held if at least two appointments of a Prime Minister fail to meet the majority votes in Parliament.</p>\r\n<p>And then, in such circumstances, the responsibility for instability and inability to form a government could return partly to the President, if there are no right arguments and explanations, because the President hasn't identified and hasn't chosen correctly, after consultations, a suitable candidate for the position of premier to form a majority. The presumption that a president would nominate a prime minister who fails in government formation and getting the vote of investiture twice, just in order to hold early elections, is fundamentally against the rules of the game and deeply reprehensible as a political game, which would disqualify the President.</p>\r\n<p>President Timofti managed to play such a game in special circumstances, when the nomination of the second candidate for prime minister, was followed by the absence of a formal majority and the absence of a proposal from the parties for an acceptable candidate. As soon as such a majority was stated, was used a different candidate than Vladimir Plahotniuc of that majority, but complying with the newly formed coalition. It's about the only limit of movement of the President. And I want to reiterate what I already said; <em>the President Nicolae Timofti will be regretted regardless of who will take the office after November 13.</em></p>\r\n<p>Regarding the arrest of a politician, businessman, ordinary citizen, criminal or notorious oligarch who stole billions, this step cannot be done by the president, not even a politician, even not the prosecutor general. I get over the procedure for appointing the prosecutor general that does not give a president him discretionary powers over that person, unless he has the consent of the majority. However, even so, the arrest in a rule of law with pretensions of being serious on a European path is done only by the court, judges, and that with the defendant's right of appeal.</p>\r\n<p>Moreover, the biggest serial killer in a rule of law has procedural guarantees and his procedural rights and individual rights for an honest defense are respected. So, the approach to arrest someone in a presidential campaign is punishable in terms of the rules of democracy, because the President has no role in the field, even the prosecutor general that is appointed, admitting that he passes all procedures, but the <em>court</em>, after two levels of jurisdiction, compliance to the rules and a final and irrevocable court decision.</p>\r\n<p>On the contrary, as a defender of the Citizen and most important a state official, once elected, the President of the Republic of Moldova must ensure and guarantee the abidance of right to a fair trial for all the citizens of the state that he leads. Yes, that is a duty of a State President, and that we expect to be provided in the electoral programs and electoral debates between the two candidates with real chances.</p>\r\n<p>Someone was saying that due to so much desire to get Andrei Nastase's electorate and demonstrate that she is sufficiently determined, Maia Sandu risks to lose her own electorate. I do not think like that, but surely <em>the segment and the real advantage of a single candidate of the pro-European right wing opposition is respecting and declaring human rights, respect for the rule of law, knowledge and application of strictly constitutional provisions, laws and provisions of other subsequent legislation and framing strict duties that belong to a head of State.</em> In this way she will win the Democrat, Liberal and European electorate of Moldova.</p>",

                "subtitlu": "",
                "lead": "The fact that brings joy in this presidential exercise is that politics becomes increasingly personalized: none of the candidates cannot longer hide behind the party lists, with many anonymous, and citizens will not find themselves with the horses of Caligula (word of Giovanii Sartori) in the Parliament. It is known, that the Roman emperor, Caligula, made his horse a senator. The allusion of famed Italian political scientist is, therefore, clear: the animals that can get - democratically! - in the representative bodies.",
                "Continut": "<p>But the great paradox of this campaign is the stubbornness with which opposition parties covet to the presidential position. The applicants behind whom is an opposition party seems to want the least a position, that is ultimately, a symbolic one. Because it is likely that in the parliamentary elections, which will take place after two years the natural complaints - which the citizen has towards any government - will be transferred as well on the party represented by the respectively president. Or in a parliamentary republic, such as Moldova, namely these elections are the main stake. Out of strategic considerations, therefore, the major political players (parties) should not be burdened with responsibilities that do not have a word too hard to say (I am referring of course to the presidency), but which, instead, can significantly reduce your parliamentary chances. However in our country the context dictates the strategy. Proof that our political actors play - pushed the parties - in the short term, which in the long term, carries the risk of disqualification. If it is not about ignorance or a miscalculation, then you wonder what the real intentions of the candidates are...  </p>\r\n<p>About stakes and assumptions. The theory says that one of the features of the ontological policy is its competitive nature. The dichotomy seizure - the maintaining of the power requires different rules and standards of behavior for actors and political institutions, reflected in the applied strategies: To smooth out - escalate (a conflict), a dialogue - a confrontation, tension - relaxation. The government will try to ensure stability in the hope that this will ensure the perpetuation in the system and the opposition, on the contrary, will try to destabilize it, just to be able to take over the power.</p>\r\n<p>Therefore, it is natural when the government wants a president to exercise his functions in strict compliance with legal provisions and the Presidency in its turn, to be involved fully in the projects assumed by the government (primarily the Association Agreement) . This country has very little time: only two years, until the parliamentary elections. And debts are big. Many reforms will arouse discussions in the society discontent, maybe even riots. However the reforms are absolutely necessary. If we compare Moldova with a seriously ill patient (and the comparison unfortunately, is required), a \"surgical intervention\" is inevitable. The reforms - of any kind - are painful - but, sometimes, it is the only way of saving the patient.</p>\r\n<p>The current government relies, obviously, on Marian Lupu, the formal leader of the Democratic Party and an experienced politician. He held important positions in the state, starting with the communist government, when President Vladimir Voronin appointed him as speaker to (as it was thought then) give a more European aspect to the rusty communist government from Chisinau. Marian Lupu's transition from the Communists to Democrats after the elections from April 2009, also has been fatal to PCRM: after the elections from 29th July 2009, it was possible a pro-European alliance. During this period Marian Lupu was the president of the Democratic Party, one of the ruling parties, occupying high state positions: chairman of Parliament (2010-2013) and Temporary President (2010-2012). Unfortunately, the benefit of those in power after 2009 has not justified the expectations of citizens. The period culminated with the bank theft. It followed the Kroll report. Then arrests, resignations and, finally, the reconfiguration of governance.</p>\r\n<p>The situation of those from the government is not to be envied. The country was basically put on blocks. The Government needs an agreement with the IMF like air, to unlock the financial isolation, which means assuming the commitments once taken for the guarantees of the bad loans, offered by the three banks. The opposition is forgetting those responsible for the theft of the billion. More than that: even victimize them! It reacts, instead, super-sensitive to the decision of the current executive of commitments offered to the NBM. It does not matter neither the arguments that the assumption is more formal, no the fact that more than half of the stolen amount was also found is to be recovered through courts, nor the fact that an agreement with the IMF would open the country's ability to access grants that excess three times the amount you have to repay.</p>\r\n<p>As we see, Marian Lupu comes on a complicated political background. He bears a part of the responsibility for the failures after 2009, but also the hope of the processes that began at the end of last year. Marian Lupu attempts to address politics as an art of the possible, while many of us, often, want the impossible.</p>\r\n<p>The stake of the opposition. The insistence with what those from the opposition crave the power betrays a hidden agenda of the protagonists, but especially of those behind them: the destabilization of the situation. If there is failure to cause early elections, or the Constitution and the context leaves little chance for it, then a permanent tension, now from the country Presidency as well. The most radical of the opposition game is the candidate of \"Our Party\", Dimitri Chubashenko. He says what the of Renato Usatii supporters want to hear: early elections, denouncing the Association Agreement, proximity to Russia. The socialist Igor Dodon speaks, as well about the anticipated elections, however it is noted that he does not believes very much in their ability. The leader of the \"DA\" Platform, Andrei Nastase, abandoned the electoral race, forwarding to Maia Sandu, with \"baton\", and a big dose of radicalism.</p>\r\n<p>Aside from the PSRM candidate, Igor Dodon, another opposition candidate with the chance to pass into the second round is Maia Sandu. I'd like to vote her as well, to be, as they say, in line with the many colleagues from the academic environment, along with many young people, some of whom are even my students, and the world wants a president with integrity, honest, competent, that is not a part from the ruling party. That in order to have \"my man\", who monitors, alarms and punishes. I try to analyze things from the perspective of the citizen who cares deeply to his vote. I analyze candidates' messages. I'm interested in everything: entourage and teams of the candidates, the present and the past of these people. I want a president who really wants a change, not simply replacing certain oligarchs with others.  </p>\r\n<p>Until the election remains less than a week. The Presidential candidates are in a straight line to the finish. From competitors is expected all kinds of accelerations and tactical moves to win. The central printing house began printing the ballot papers. One of them is mine. I would want to use it judiciously as possible, not to screw it up, to vote after I will be very well balanced. That is my urge to yourself as well.</p>",

                "lead": "We are in a period (2016 - the year of grace, namely in October, a week before the elections of the President), and in a country of paradoxes (Moldova), where one plus one can - on the contrary to what mathematicians think and most frequently - two, or sometimes even three or five, as an effect of training the electoral movements and emotions, on the background of hope recovery. However they can make also 1.3 or less than 1, if the progress is chaotic, confused, disappointing for the voter. As the first round of direct presidential elections is approaching, let's see how could Maia Sandu - the single candidate of the pro-European right wing opposition - not get into the second round of voting.",
                "Continut": "<p>Several kinds of factors such as: <em>external</em>, belonging to the opposition candidates, \"friends\", counter-candidates with the same voters, and <em>internal</em>, own strategies of campaign or candidate's ones. As many sources of errors, gaffes, inappropriate actions, inadequate choices, unfortunate public interventions. Let's take them one by one.</p>\r\n<p>At the chapter of <em>external factors belonging to the counter-candidates</em>, we could list the hits below the belt, public statements or spreading misinformation on the candidate; or a spectacular hit for the image, done through Russia (most probably, for supporting Igor Dodon), or through the government.</p>\r\n<p>The second external factor is the use of <em>administrative and governmental resources</em>, frauds, to bring Marian Lupu to the second round. Such an option would be suicidal for the pro-European government itself, but also because it questions the fairness of the elections - as well the action of the pro-European government - generating massive street demonstrations.</p>\r\n<p>At the chapter of <em>external factors that came from friends and competitors</em> on the same electorate, I would cite two major sources: <em>the candidacy of Iurie Leanca</em>, who sits on the same electorate as LDPM and although he was requested by the President of the European People's Party, Joseph Daul, to withdraw, although he received explicit signals from German partners, which he relied on, through the appearance and statements of Merkel supporting the single candidate of the pro-European opposition, refuses to withdraw from the campaign and steals other 2-3, maybe 5% of the votes of Maia Sandu, enough to enter the second round.</p>\r\n<p>There is also a possibility that <em>Andrei Nastase</em>'s actions during this period and his insistence in combat the \"bad oligarch\" may lead to directing his electorate towards Igor Dodon, not to Maia Sandu. Moreover: this behavior may weaken the chances of the second round.</p>\r\n<p>In the same train of thoughts we could further record the<em> internal mistakes of the campaign of Maia Sandu</em>. Here I would include two: the preeminence of external support, Maia Sandu preferring to go to the meeting of the EPP, instead of all the leaders who chose her as a common candidate to hurry up and support her in local rallies in the country and in actions concerted by all the teams in the territory. <em>The votes are won in Moldova, not in Brussels.</em> The second is at the boundary between the internal factor, the staff, and external factor that comes from friends. Simpler, it's about borrowing from PPDA two themes, both costly and counter-productive.</p>\r\n<p>First one:<strong> early elections </strong>(impossible - I repeat what I have said in previous editorials - the condition in which there is a stable government and majority, in addition to what the Constitution provides in this respect).</p>\r\n<p>The second one: <strong>the arrest of the oligarch</strong><strong> </strong>or at least the appointment of a prosecutor general to arrest him. An approach that can be qualified as deeply non-European and undemocratic to the relationship between state powers. Or, even worse, as a temptation of the future President to use the political and judicial power in order to resolve with administrative means a problem that is, in fact, the responsibility of justice. A justice where even the president, does not interfere, even the prosecutor (who does not arrest, only detains) and the courts can arrest only after a final and irrevocable decision.</p>\r\n<p>Finally, there are probable mistakes of Maia Sandu as a candidate, too. The refusal to take the common support of the three political forces that decided the single candidate, non-involving in serious battles for elections by avoiding direct confrontations with relevant candidates, lack of training in foreign policy, defense and security, gaps in training on major subjects and issues of Moldova. If seized and presented as such, all this could be considerable vulnerabilities even in the first round,.</p>\r\n<p>Finally, there are also mistakes of Maia Sandu as a candidate. The refusal to take the common support of the three political forces that chosen the single candidate, non-involvement in serious battles for elections by avoiding direct confrontations with relevant candidates, lack of training in foreign policy, defense and security, gaps in knowledge on major subjects and issues concerning Moldova. If seized and exhibited as such, all this could be considerable vulnerabilities even in the first round.</p>\r\n<p>After October 30, the stakes are changing and the speech should adapt to the new reality and second round. Now, however, the action needs to be reassessed: from the promotion of Maia Sandu to the fight with Dodon. <em>Stop Dodon! Stop Moldova's sinking in deep Siberia! Stop the federalization of the state!</em> - This is how should sound a campaign slogan in the second round.</p>",

                "lead": "And, what was supposed to happen, happened! Marian Lupu, the PDM President withdrew from the electoral race for the Presidency of the Republic of Moldova and left the place for the sole candidate of the pro-European forces, Maia Sandu. Shortly after, the PPEM leader, Iurie Leanca, as well announced his withdrawal from the race. The beneficiary of these votes, became the single pro-European candidate, who has rejected the partial support, trying to keep away from Vladimir Plahotniuc at this stage, to avoid the turn of the second round of elections in one of the pro/anti-oligarch or the pro/anti-captive state and to be able to pass the responsibility of an approach to Vladimir Plahotniuc at least equally to Igor Dodon, with whom he would have met in Cyprus, and would be negotiating  also the merger of the two parties, the PSRM and the PDM.",
                "Continut": "<p>The PD candidate, Marian Lupu announced at the press briefing that was marking the withdrawal from the electoral race, which will have its first round on Sunday, October 30, that he will support Maia Sandu. The president urged the voters of the party he leads, to support the candidate who is most likely to defeat the pro-Russian candidate Igor Dodon.</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p><em>\"I analyzed during the today meeting, the latest data that show the last minute movement of choosing the joint candidate did not give expected results probably because it was made very late. A large part of PPDA electorate has actually strengthened not the right but the left wing, in particular the candidate of \"Our Party\". Even the advance of Maia Sandu is not a considerable one, percentages in polls remain quite close between us, within the margin of error, and with relatively equal opportunities for both in the second round. The candidate who will reach the second round should be a pro-European one. Also, the PAS candidate has the best chance to beat Igor Dodon. We have results at the limit. Altogether with my colleagues I have decided to retire from the race. The message that I send to the PDM electorate is to support the candidate who has a chance to beat the Socialist candidate,\"</em> declared Lupu.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>The leader of the PAS, Maia Sandu, commented the decision of the President of PDM, Marian Lupu, regarding his withdrawal from the presidential race, arguing that she does not needs the support from the PDM team, and Lupu's withdrawal means the fact that the PSRM leader, Igor Dodon, is the desired candidate of Vlad Plahotniuc. In a Facebook post she wrote that \"PD decided to wash its image by declaring this FALSE support for me\". \"The circus continues. Plahotniuc was afraid that people's vote will show how little support has the candidate of the government, Marian Lupu. It's a desperate gesture confirming that Dodon is Plahotniuc's desired candidate. We can come to an agreement with him,\" stated Maia Sandu, in an unsuitable approach of the campaign strategy. Instead the PLDM president, Viorel Cibotaru, welcomed the withdrawal of the competitors who have decided to allow to the unique candidate of the right wing opposition to accede on its own in the competition with Igor Dodon.</p>\r\n<p>PDM motivated the movement by the national interest of the pro-European orientation of Moldova, a welcomed gesture by the way. The battles at the level of the pro-Europeans are traditional, but nothing compares to the forefront appearance of a federalist and willing to break the Association Agreement with the EU, pro-Russian President of the Republic of Moldova, as the Socialist pro-Russian candidate, Igor Dodon, announced that it will be.</p>\r\n<p>The today's gesture marks a strong change in the electoral fringes and gives an impulse of a clotting trend of the pro-European forces in the second round. Moreover, the movement with major emotional impact, and the ability to bring hope for the public, but until the second round is enough time for such a move to be balanced, by placing Andrei Nastase, the nominee of the PPDA, who was the first to withdraw from the race, but did not support Maia Sandu for real, to have her back now, and of Dumitru Ciubashenko, the candidate of \"Our Party\", the pro-Russian, behind Igor Dodon. The battle for the presidency of the Republic of Moldova and for the European path still goes on. </p>\r\n<p>For conformity, here is also the editorial prepared in time to greet the end the election week in Chisinau:</p>\r\n<p><strong>Monstrous scandal at Kiev: Dodon has blown up the relations with both neighbors of Moldova</strong></p>\r\n<p>Igor Dodon, the Socialist nominee for President of Moldova, did not lie to himself and showed to every citizen that will go to the voting on October 30, at the first round of the direct Presidential elections, that he defends the interests of the Russian Federation and that he will blow up all the relationships of the State, whose president wants to be, with its neighbors. Igor Dodon already has become Persona non grata in the relationship with Romania, once he said that he wants Moldova's reorientation towards Russia and the federalization of the state with the eastern regions under Russian occupation. More recently, he wanted to show that he breaks the relations with the state's other neighbor, Ukraine.</p>\r\n<p>In a debate on the RTR Moldova TV channel - belonging to Russian state television - Igor Dodon claimed that Crimea belongs to Russia. \"The question, on which our viewer Andrey Bashtannik insists, is a matter of prime importance to him - to whom belongs the Crimea?\" asked Dodon the presenter. \"To the Russian Federation,\" stated Dodon. \"So do you mean ...\" intervened the presenter to ask for clarifications. \"You heard me,\" replied Dodon interrupting the reporter.</p>\r\n<p>The issue of the membership of Crimea to Ukraine is important not only for Ukraine, but it is crucial for the entire world, which defends the rules of the international law, namely the sovereignty, the territorial integrity and the independence of the states, who rejects the revisionism and the unilateral interventionism of Russia for \"defending the Russians and the Russian speakers compatriots\", the item for which Moscow assumed unilateral rights to the territories inhabited by them.</p>\r\n<p>More seriously, the approach affects directly and the Republic of Moldova and has a precedent title, especially since we are talking about a state that also has a conflict on its territory, artificially constructed by Russia through the presence of its troops in the eastern districts of Moldova and through the support for separatism. If Dodon becomes President, this approach is suicidal over any Western partner, but even from the CIS states.</p>\r\n<p>Already the relations of Igor Dodon with Romania would be strained since he wants a shift in strategic direction of Moldova and the denunciation of the Association Agreement EU-Moldova. An unprecedented situation after the efforts made to reach the European path, to make reforms, to adopt laws and to achieve the institutional building on the European model. In addition, Moldova has received grants and a reimbursable aid from Romania, the first installment already reaching to Chisinau, and also the support for the interconnection energy projects of gas and electrical current. All the conditions for maintaining the European path of Moldova, a strategic objective mentioned by Romania in all its strategic documents. Strategic reorientation would cancel these agreements.</p>\r\n<p>Practically, the election of Igor Dodon means the isolation of Moldova between Romania and Ukraine, its only two neighbors. If by this time there were doubts about how it will react Dodon after the election, whether he will recognize or not the program, saying that he must be the president of all citizens, now the Socialist candidate was explicit and he marked this perspective without the right to an appeal, without the possibility of ever having any comeback, being pronounced in full electoral campaign and found himself not only in his own electoral program, but is also being reinforced in the show from Russian state television branch in Chisinau.</p>",

                "Continut": "<p><strong>Giving up or wise decision?</strong></p>\r\n<p>PD's decision to withdraw its candidate from the presidential race was more than surprising. At the end of the campaign, it was like a thunderbolt in full fall, which shook the national political field. However, always, gives up the wise one. We may also say \"most powerful\", because wisdom can provide social power. All the excitement that followed shows that some politicians approach politics as a chess game, and others - as an ordinary card game - \"shithead\".</p>\r\n<p><strong>Lose the battle but win the war</strong></p>\r\n<p>In politics, the long-term calculations (i.e. strategies!) are essential. And they are drawn up from a major purpose: the perpetuation in governance. Tactics, in turn, serve for the implementation of strategies. Mistakes in political strategies formulation and implementation can be fatal. To evaluate strategies, it is important to analyze contexts.</p>\r\n<p>We have a current frame and another one more distant. The current context is obviously marked by the electoral campaign. And games, usually, cannot be changed. All that can be done is just trying to somehow change their vision. The strategic approach requires a deeper vision, and foresight at the same time. Without such an analysis, (where, as we know, hides the unexpected) you miss the details.</p>\r\n<p>Our political system adopted - as we know - parliamentary method of governance. This requires for participants in political competition - parliamentary elections. Legally, they are in two years. Very little time to trigger important changes. At the same time, reforms are not waiting, any procrastination is fatal; Republic of Moldova, perhaps, goes through the most difficult period since Independence. The banking crisis has affected the whole society. The reason of problems lies in the political system and the solution must be sought still there. Follows an extremely complicated period when reforms, difficult and unpopular, risky and dangerous under political aspect for those who have initiated them are inevitable. That is why it is vital a wider attraction of different political forces in this process: it diminishes from the populist message and the confrontation potential, which can be accumulated during reforms.</p>\r\n<p>The history of transitions with systemic nature abounds in examples, when reformers paid politically for the changes. Usually, others enjoy (if caught, because in most cases it is awaited) the political benefits. So, it is in the interest of the initiators of the reforms in the process of changing to attract as many political forces, including potential political opponents.</p>\r\n<p><strong>The electoral context</strong></p>\r\n<p>As we know, in compliance with the Constitution, the president's powers are modest. Meanwhile, in the general mindset - marked by paternalism - the presidency is one of the institutions of power, which generates great expectations among citizens. This mindset allows some political forces in society to use the problems to monopolize political capital. Given that the main stake is, as I mentioned, the parliamentary elections (to which, moreover, remained very little time), it is rational by keeping control over the main state levers to share responsibility with potential competitors on the same side of the political spectrum. That is why, in our case, it is reasonable, rational and politically justified, the withdrawal of the democratic candidate from the race in favor of a political competitor better positioned on the political scene.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Why Maia Sandu?</strong></p>\r\n<p>The democrats and followers of Maia Sandu share, largely the same electoral pool, so the battle is on the same political spectrum. However, unlike the Socialist leader also under pressure from development partners, Maia Sandu will have to support unpopular reforms, but necessary one, dictated by the implementation of the Association Agreement. An eventual victory of Dodon is less suitable for PD, because it's another electoral pool that government can count on only partially, and you can recruit only after tangible results. Meanwhile, chosen as president and speculating problems and hardships, PSRM leader will have an additional platform to promote his populist message, perpetuating a state of confrontation, social and political instability.</p>\r\n<p>Without realizing it, Maia Sandu and her political partners have swallowed this lure, and now will have to play till the end. Insulting and offensive statements to those who offer support is betraying the confusion and frustration in the camp of the single candidate. These days, like feeling something, PAS candidate was warning that PSRM and PD were preparing something to put her in embarrassing positions. A worse political positioning is hard to invent. In case of failure, the excuse is ready: Marian Lupu's withdrawal was made in favor of Igor Dodon. Well, quite wrong! The apolitical and arrogant behavior of the PAS leader has made some candidates - sharing the same electoral pool as Sandu - to cancel plans to withdraw from the race. That most likely will send the elections in the second round, where Maia Sandu will not have anyone to blame.</p>",

                "lead": "The presidential elections have ended in the first round as expected: Igor Dodon, the pro-Russian Socialist candidate, the representative of the old system of doing politics, the conservative and defender of the system, will face in the second round of voting with Maia Sandu, the PAS pro-reformist candidate, the newly established party. The balance of power after the first round is 48-38%, and 10 percent remain fatefully to recover. If we simplify, basically 6 percent are coming from the PPEM pro-European candidates, PL and Ghiletchi. In the middle remains Dimitri Ciubashenko, the pro-Russian candidate of Renato Usatii, who refused to transfer the votes and demanded the commitment of Dodon to lift the warrant of arrest of the head of his party, Renato Usatii, the mayor of Balti, in exchange for the votes.",
                "Continut": "<p>The situation is far from clear, especially since again it has been played on the edge of this second round and there was, at some point, the actual risk of winning the election in the first round. In addition, the low turnout, especially of active segments 18-25, 26-40 years and in the Diaspora, namely in Romania made the score to show the officially report announced by the Central Election Commission, which organized the elections excellent, with transparency and sociological data base.</p>\r\n<p>What is next at the second round? A fight and a very important job to maintain Moldova's European path unaltered. Because, it must be said, even if the parliamentary majority and the government remain in office, as well as the commitments to reforms, as the need for conditional external financing, however, the election for a pro-Russian president means instability, isolation and pressure on stopping these reforms, even forcing the takeover by Dodon's pro-Russian socialists of the total power by early elections, if there is opportunity in time. Therefore, Igor Dodon should be stopped. In addition, the symbolism of such a win, creates major problems or opportunities for non-friends of Moldova in the West to build their embassies and to ignore this border land, because people do not really want the European path and Western options that are unconsolidated.</p>\r\n<p>So the first topic of the upcoming two weeks is<strong> the stake</strong>. And I reject the tend to use proper diplomatic formulations, which welcomes the fair organisation of the elections and that we will work with any president in the spirit of good neighborliness to say that it does not matter who will lead Moldova to the West to Romania, EU and USA. Of course, it will matter! Look at the reaction of Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine and the withdrawal of the Ambassador for consultations! So revealing <strong>of the STAKE</strong> and promotion of the divergent options which are represented by Igor Dodon and Maia Sandu are required and this can make the difference in shaking the society and waking up to the reality of those who want reforms and equal access to opportunities, equal and fair justice and combating the corruption wherever it is, regardless of the concerned person.</p>\r\n<p>Afterwards we enter under the sign of mobilization capabilities and consistent campaign strategies. And here it is about the strategies of the two campaigns to prove their skill, relying on the fact that, if Romania and the EU stated that they do not get involved in the campaign, and Russia already did it, only subtly, through the asset on the ground and some funding, in the second tour Moscow's impact might be more substantial and direct. In addition, we should note that a competitor, Igor Dodon, tries to carve his victory through negotiations at the green table, possibly even under the foot of Mother Russia, in Moscow, and not through fair, face to face competition.</p>\r\n<p>After he received the communists refusal because Vladimir Voronin considers him a bought traitor and he rejects his support in the second round, but even after rejecting his automatic support for Dmitri Ciubashenko, Igor Dodon announced that he will fly on Friday to Moscow to see Renato Usatii, the \"Our Party\" leader, who is wanted internationally for complicity/ordering of a murder. So while he does not make campaign unless at his own television stations and through press releases, he refuses to submit his program and especially to face in live televised debates, in front of the nation from which he requires the vote, with his rival, preferring blows below the belt by relatively anonymous online environments, Igor Dodon is able to break the law, to refuse the separation of powers in the State, to ensure impunity for Renato Usatai and that he will raise the international warrant prosecution in return of his support in the second round. Some President of Moldova! He is not able to be a man neithe in a confrontation with a woman and to take a deserved victory, with fair play, face to face. And therefore, Maia Sandu deserves to win the race.</p>",

                "lead": "The President-elect of Moldova, from Sunday evening to Monday, is Igor Dodon. Every citizen of Moldova likes it or not, supported him or not, voted for him or not, must recognize him as president. That is democracy. It does not mean to believe in him, to applaud or to caution him in any way. No. Just to agree that he is president-elect of the state. Otherwise, everyone is free to remain critical of the part of Igor Dodon and penalize drastically (and even vocally) each deviation from the Constitution, from the common sense or the options for which all the citizens have voted.",
                "Continut": "<p>After the thrill was shattered and vindictive impulses, sorrow and discontent faded, in Chisinau remains the democratic reality of installation, through direct vote of a declared pro-Russian president. And, at the international level, especially for the neighbors across the Prut, in Romania, but also for the second neighbor of Moldova, Ukraine, the concern is inherent, and the method of approach of the new president is still undefined. Naturally that depends on his behavior, and the ability to re-balance and to become - as he promised - the President of all his countrymen, dealing effectively with the tasks devolving upon the state. Lucidity, calm, judging by actions, not by campaign words - this is how will pass the first period, in which the new president-elect, undoubtedly, will be under everyone's attention.</p>\r\n<p>Also, the monitoring is profound, deep and meticulous. It cannot be otherwise until the answers to the fundamental questions of Moldova and those of any capital are formulated: the continuity of the European path, the decision regarding the reforms, the use of power tools to determine possible early elections. Next the key question: whether there have been discussions on new submittal based on commitments towards Moscow, concerning the pressure of tearing the EU Association Agreement (which means reintroducing visas).</p>\r\n<p>However, it will be hard for anyone to be convinced by Dodon's reorientation from the campaign. Acceptable safeguards are few and the legitimacy of the new President of the Republic of Moldova to the West is reduced. Now the dilemma is: he will change his position and maintain the pro-European path, thus, tricking his voters (but keeping instead, the strategic orientation), or he will be consistent with his electoral program and he will break the Association Agreement?</p>\r\n<p>However, this is still the simplest question that the new president must answer. There are other things more important. How will he relate with the Parliament, the Government, with Plahotniuc? You can desire to change everything, but at first you must collaborate with state institutions and be careful what you are doing. As for Mr.P, things are much more confusing.</p>\r\n<p>Is there or not an understanding and money between the two main actors of the political scene in Chisinau is less important than the - obvious - fact that the two represent distinct mentalities. And they will face each other as any holders of real power: Dodon, from his position of president and leader of an opposition party, became the most powerful today, and Plahotniuc, from the master and owner of a large part of lucrative business from Moldova, a man with entrepreneurial spirit (and not infrequently salesman) and who transformed Moldova into a company run by an authoritarian holder of a controlling interest of the shares.</p>\r\n<p>Sunday's election brought a new and fresh pole in the political life of the Republic of Moldova: Maia Sandu, the current official leader (and symbolically, at the same time) the right wing opposition from the street. Difficult choices in which were used all less clean means. Yet the PAS leader has obtained an unexpected second place with less than 5% from the votes behind the winner. Now this dowry must be institutionalized, and to strengthen a political force requires the access to resources after leaving aside the naivety, amateurism and romanticism for pragmatism and professionalism. Here's the big stake in this period of political construction in the 2018 general elections.</p>\r\n<p>The three principles of power in Chisinau - Igor Dodon (the authority), Plahotniuc (the money and resources) and Maia Sandu (the opposition with the symbolic power of the prestige) - will settle down in the end. Will occupy the space of power, will take over seats and institutions and certainly will face each other in the future. Especially the first two. And this seems to be the struggle for power of the future. The stakes for Moldova's European path passes, also, through fragile balances and changes, we hope, not overly sharp. And, of course, through the opposition personified by Maia Sandu, the opposition has a duty to monitor the reforms of the Executive and to prepare for the next campaign.</p>",

                "lead": "A NATO Liaison Office will be set up in Chisinau after an agreement to this effect was signed on Tuesday by Prime Minister Pavel Filip and NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg, who mentioned in the press conference that the new office is a civilian one and not a military base. “The new NATO Liaison Office will be important for our political support but also for our practical support for the Republic of Moldova. This is a small, civilian office - not a military base. It is about cooperation, not about imposing NATO priorities or membership on Moldova. NATO fully respects Moldova’s neutrality,” Stoltenberg declared.",
                "Continut": "<p>This news appeared almost simultaneously with the private visit of, not validated yet, President-elect of the Republic of Moldova, Igor Dodon to Moscow and is meant to represent, symbolically and factually, a strong reinsurance formula that the election of a pro-Russian President will not change the strategic orientation of Moldova. Indeed, the crucial issue of the presidential election from November 13 was a very complicated signal given and the interpretations that could come with major costs for Moldova.</p>\r\n<p>After humbling the new president, with somehow voluntaristic beginnings, at first, shown by Speaker Andrian Candu on the limits of his responsibilities, here today Prime Minister Filip takes an important step which means both a reaffirmation of the strategic orientation and strengthening the relationship with NATO and the US, and a signal of the need to reform the defense sector and the program to increase the defense capability of the Republic of Moldova, that Romania has brought Chisinau to and thanks to the substantial contributions of the Ministers of Defense Anatol Salaru and Viorel Cibotaru. And today the signal is even more consistent, because Anatol Salaru already announced the desire to eliminate the Soviet symbolism in military units and the eternal tank that guards the left side of Prut and whose place is already at the museum. Despite the symbolic gestures of night guarding the pieces of metal through the country, done by socialists.</p>\r\n<p>The signal was absolutely necessary because the concern was important and the assurances had to have a powerful content, not only promises, a list of immediate reforms or a roadmap, presented at European level. Chisinau understood that it takes a strong, consistent and symbolic message, and it gave it. Moreover, as the IMF agreement was concluded, it should be known that funding is also based on good relations, reforms and strategic pro-Western orientation, relations with NATO, US and EU, and not done for the reorientation of Moldova to Moscow. It should still be proved that Igor Dodon will come up with money and will not give commitments that he cannot meet or do not mean putting down Moldova's sovereignty and returning to the former Soviet Empire.</p>\r\n<p>Opening the NATO liaison office in Chisinau comes after many efforts in Moldova itself. While we remember the hardships such a step encountered, about a year and a half waiting in parliament and then blocked in the commission for foreign policy by Marian Lupu, PD candidate to the Presidency of the Republic of Moldova, loss of budget for the current year, all these difficulties are felt today when things were exceeded. After the establishment of NATO Contact Point, provided at the beginning by Romania, after the establishment of the Information and Documentation Centre on NATO - IDC on NATO, all when Vladimir Voronin was president, now Moldova takes the next step, made before Igor Dodon installment to avoid limiting his area of movement in relation to Russia, if it can bring something new to Moldova through good offices.</p>\r\n<p>And it seems that Russia also intends to mark symbolically the victory in Chisinau of its pupil because did not want to sign the elimination of the embargo on vegetables and fruits already negotiated by the intergovernmental mixed commission Moldova - Russia, held this week in Moscow, but wants the new president to come on official visit by the end of the year and after a meeting with Vladimir Putin, to validate this document. In place of Mr. Dodon, I would be worried about this, because may appear pressures and lists of actions requested by Russia which concern the new president. Anyway, attention will be on him and on the commitments he personally takes in Moscow, knowing the limits of his mandate and duties, which limits drastically his voluntaristic intentions and even the ability to employ something else than his own will in discussions with the Russian side.</p>",

                "lead": "The President of Romania Klaus Johannis, refused to answer to the tirades launched by Igor Dodon, freshly voted president of Moldova, responding weighted and meaningfully to the questions of journalists. Besides, the President of Romania made a subtle instruction related to the protocol and good manners to the next President of the Republic of Moldova, which will come into office after the conclusion of legal issues related to electoral complaints and misconduct, claimed by the participants in the second round of presidential elections on 13 December on the left side of Prut.",
                "Continut": "<p>\"We did not discuss various interviews of various political personalities in Moldova. We refer to a very serious approach, very important and very necessary for clarification of the situation of projects and approaches from Romania to Moldova. For us, no matter who says, what says one or the other, Moldova is very important and we want to be a partner that helps Moldova,\" said the Romanian President when asked how will work the working group responsible for this action plane considering that Igor Dodon has already requested the ratification of the border treaty.</p>\r\n<p>Journalist: — Will you respond to these statements?</p>\r\n<p>Klaus Iohannis: — You know that there are diplomatic usages. Now, even if Mr. Dodon is not yet the President of Moldova and he will understand it, step by step, how you must act between Presidents...</p>\r\n<p>The Romanian President shall notify implicitly, to Mr. Dodon, that the stature of the President does not allow just anything, but it limits the communication at the appropriate level of partners for discussion. A president does not responding to a party chief of a neighboring state, especially in public. Then even if he got to be President, Mr. Dodon must understand that to get answers and to have a dialogue, firstly his queries must be resolved with the Moldovan government. Afterwards there could be factors discussed by him, by the state administration, at technical and political levels inferior to those of another State. Given the fact of his constitutional tasks, of simple representation, wuthout executive atributions, Mr. Dodon has an extremely narrow and strict space of topics of discussion with his counterparts, including with the President of Romania, which has the executive responsibilities of Foreign, Security and Defense Policy.</p>\r\n<p>Finally, in order to have a proper meeting, there should be a proper agenda, wrought at technical and political levels inferior, in order for the presidents to address to it and the context must be adequate. It will never be a meeting when the customs are not complied and the minimum rules of politeness related to bilateral talks and compliance with the other's position. Mr. Dodon lacks today the detachment from the problems of identity and historical, that must be left to the specialists, regardless of his personal options, and the respect for individual human rights, namely the right to vote and to be elected - namely to be an official even if you have and the second citizenship, respectively you are a Romanian citizen - and the right to freedom of speech, the right of assembly and public manifestation of the protest even if you are a unionist. Until these points are not made, points of principle, Mr. Igor Dodon cannot meet with the Romanian President because the meeting represents a political validation of him, it does not reflects only a good stage of bilateral relations.</p>\r\n<p>President-elect, Igor Dodon, reacted to statements of Romanian President, Klaus Johannis, insisting on an open letter from this spring, launched as party leader. Again, the approach on facebook and in public space of the discussions of the President of Romania is unusual, and the polemical tone does not help at all, because the Romanian President will not engage in public disputes with his Moldovan counterpart.</p>\r\n<p>Indirectly, Igor Dodon received the complete response to his wishes, in time. <em>He just has to learn to read these answers.</em> Even at the CSAT, the Romanian President, Klaus Johannis, says that: \"Our goal is to help Moldova to become stronger, to have stronger institutions and to continue the pro-European course.\" So the question of strengthening and reforming the Moldovan state in the European sense is in order. This is the assumed goal of the Romanian state. In perspective, when it will be possible, the European integration of Moldova. So let's be ready for the moment when the opportunity presents itself. The remark marks, indirectly, and the real ratio between the donor and the receiver of the assistance, plasing Igor Dodon in his place and showing him, in fact, that reporting to a donor willing and without conditions should be made by complying with the strategic direction of the State whose president is also respecting the rules of the game between countries. If not, he will enter into irrelevance and will get public answers only at the journalistic and political/polemicist level, and he will not ever get to discuss something in Bucharest. <em>The Prime Minister of Moldova will do it, however, when will be needed...</em></p>",

                "Continut": "<p><strong>The third factor of power established by the Presidential elections</strong></p>\r\n<p>Presidential elections in Moldova, carried out in the second round on November 13, have established a third political factor in the foreground in Moldova, in addition to the declared <strong>pro-European power</strong>, where Prime Minister Pavel Filip and Speaker Andrian Candu manifest themselves in the proscenium, and behind the curtain is the informal leader Vladimir Plahotniuc and President-elect Igor Dodon, who is the leader of the Socialists, a pro-Russian. <em>Indeed, due to finishing on the second place of the presidential elections, Maia Sandu, president of PAS, became the leader of the pro-European opposition in Moldova through the prism of almost 48% of votes obtained.</em></p>\r\n<p>However, the legitimacy given by the voting is not sufficient to establish a fact, a political truth. Of course, we have a candidate who went through her first electoral battle, came out with an honorable result, even if the lack of experience and training was seen with the naked eye. The major problem, once the elections have passed, <em>is how Maia Sandu makes the most of this position</em>, i.e. the vote, confidence and hopes she has catalyzed. And here are only two choices.</p>\r\n<p>The easiest is to neglect it without acting for <strong>joining victory and consecration of the leader of the pro-European opposition</strong> in the political reality. Maia Sandu had already to come out publicly with the <strong>political project of the pro-European united right</strong> to announce the fight to win the parliamentary elections in November 2018 in the formula of an alliance / coalition / block, to establish, firstly, <strong>the solidarity and the political force of the pro-European right opposition</strong>, after that the <strong>possible alliances</strong> with those who supported her in the presidential runoff; or necessary boundaries.</p>\r\n<p><strong>The absence of the project and future political vision</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>The lack of a political project, a political vision and a future goal </strong><strong>sends Maia Sandu in irrelevance as quicker, as the closest allies move forward one at a time as days go by. If she fails to establish <em>even</em> <em>now</em> a committed party structure, as PLDM, Maia Sandu and her party in the patching together stage are lost. The same fate will have PPDA, the other ally, if it departs from the project established by the voting on November 13 and its outcome. </strong><strong>Unraveling this formula makes any project - and efforts to achieve it - to be totally unimportant.</strong></p>\r\n<p>Building a party is not a simple thing, it is known. All right pro-European leaders felt it on their own skin. Moreover, <strong>the absence of a previous electoral validation</strong> of PPDA and PAS, as their lack of structures makes PLDM administrative impact more apparent. Eventually, the role-playing is the relevant one, and Maia Sandu, based on t<strong>he legitimacy achieved by the voting</strong>, has the power to put together the pieces on this political mosaic. I do not know how she will act. However, the anarchist<strong>-revolutionary wanderings of Andrei Nastase</strong>, reinstated as a politics guru on the set of his favorite television channel, is not helping, on the contrary, it shows <strong>the temptation of expanding individually again</strong> and lack of learned lessons from the presidential elections.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Voters have voted for the idea of Maia Sandu - a pro-European right-wing candidate</strong></p>\r\n<p>The absence of a political project, a vision and attitudes <strong>to devote the result from the presidential election</strong> is letting down the fact that Maia Sandu has not learned the lessons from the campaign. Without a professional team. without goals and a backbone of <strong>a pragmatic and realistic program, adapted to the reality of Moldova</strong>, without a mature positioning compared to the other two factors of power, especially against the pro-European declared government, Maia Sandu is doomed to failures. In addition, here combines the complete absence of a professional team for the campaign with the lack of proper lines of thought, adapted to the reality, after a thorough study of the results of the vote from November 13, at the sociological and political level.</p>\r\n<p>Because Maia Sandu has no <strong>professional team for policy and campaign consultation</strong>, has no financial resources to hire such a team, has no confidence in such a team or is too stubborn to ever listening it. On the other hand, <strong>she is too influenced by pseudo-experts and third-string analysts </strong>and, more essentially, with <em>their own agendas</em>, plus that she had no chance of a <em>professional filter</em> that would show firstly the campaign's mistakes. And here it must be said very clearly: <strong>Maia Sandu could won easily these presidential elections</strong> with a more intense personal training, with a professional team, with some money which, however, would have come and, again, with a more active filter for the advises of the closest and loyal supporters, but not knowing, or away and with an established image instead of <em>their own interests</em>.</p>\r\n<p>And the biggest mistake of the campaign is that she did not answer to the <strong>great subjects of political positioning on the realities from Moldova</strong>: strategic pro-European orientation, ideological resort of the right, association with the European People's Party, political pragmatism of clotting the right wing in Moldova to attract voters of all colors and shades. This caused the <strong>groping of voters who have voted for the idea of Maia Sandu</strong> - a pro-European right-wing candidate, no, unfortunately, for <strong>the substance of this candidate</strong> who has shown serious deficiencies of consistency and self-definition. Until the aspirational image and waiting perception from the votes of November 13 will not be decrypted and translated into the reality of a pragmatic program, to be addressed, the risk of repeating failure, but especially <strong>the absence of the expected character</strong> will translate into a return to the initial votes that Maia Sandu had before being nominated as the sole candidate of the right pro-European opposition.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Winter holidays close the opportunity window</strong></p>\r\n<p>Therefore, Maia Sandu may be anytime the <strong>leader of the right pro-European opposition of the presidential elections</strong>, which was extinguished like a flash in the pan by circumstantial character and transience of her presence in politics. A meteoric passage that has been used only once and is getting into irrelevancy faster than anyone expected. In addition, wasting hopes of hundreds of thousands of voters in Moldova and abroad.</p>\r\n<p>However, approaching <strong>the winter holidays permanently close the opportunity window</strong> that Maia Sandu is still having. And, unfortunately, we see her either in complete silence on the medium-term draft or vocalizing still <strong>minor issues and marginal civic moralism typical for the pre-election period</strong>, themes that bring her back at 10-15% of  votes of intellectuals deeply inadequate for the real political life of Moldova.</p>",

                "lead": "The fact that the presidential election would be lost by the European side was obvious even before it was announced. To predict it, you were not supposed to be a prophet. It was enough to follow the recent political events, the results of sociological surveys, the social-economic context, the general atmosphere in the society. It's not possible to provoke - under the cover of European integration - a big financial crisis, without being punished by the electorate: after the negative transfer of image, the pro-European vector has been damaged.",
                "Continut": "<p>Firstly, it was a party whose leader was seen as the biggest, the most important and, in fact, the only one: a kind of chief over the whole country. That is why had declared - as one of his political priorities - the election of the President by the entire population. Sounds good. Dare to oppose when it comes to people - the exponent of national sovereignty. The suit of the public enemy would be assured for you. The idea of a president elected by the people was taken then to a platform whose leaders have named themselves - fighters for justice and truth. Try now to fight back! You risk to be sentenced to life. And yet there were some realists, who stated bluntly - referring to the teachings of history - that where the poverty, corruption and lies are prevailing, usually, the populists are chosen. In our country (the local contribution, so to speak), the favorite of the surveys in eve of the elections remained against the grain of custom, the candidate of the left, that is the pro-Russian...</p>\r\n<p>For the end of the drama remained two competitors: Igor Dodon, and Maia Sandu. The socialist opt for a closer relationship with Russia and the revision of the Association Agreement with the European Union. Why must be reviewed the document that, according to the experts, is very good and even favors us, the Socialist leader avoided to tell us. Judging by the results of the first round (which by the way, were not contested), it appears that people believed him. In the second round, Igor Dodon has diluted the anti-European and anti-Romanian message, trying to convince us, slightly more insistently that by staying simultaneously in two boats is not only possible, but, apparently, even beneficial for the organism! By examining the preliminary results of the second round, this time as well we find that most voters have given credence to the allegations launched by candidate PSRM. As mentioned, a large part of Moldovans in the autumn of 2016, would be vote for Igor Dodon, regardless of what the socialist leader would have said. And the politician said exactly what they wanted to hear. As for those who have not yet understood this feature of politics in the XXI century - the marketing - we can only envy them. If it's just naive, of course!</p>\r\n<p>The second candidate, Maia Sandu was really unique. She tried - in a kind of historical premiere - to unite the anti-oligarchic message with the oligarchs that stood somewhere behind her. To combine the halo of holiness, which her advocates endeavored to create for her, with the sins of her staying in government; and the pretense of a charismatic political leader, with, alas, the disappointing developments of the direct election debates. The PAS leader's performance, but also of her staff will remain, as an always instructive chapter in the annals of electoral absurd, particularly through the applied tactics.</p>\r\n<p>Surprisingly for many, in the presidential runoff was recorded an exemplary mobilization of the diaspora, who has given us to understand that we are not alone and that, in fact, all is not lost.</p>\r\n<p>Now we were watching the court (which examines the appeals submitted by the staff of Maia Sandu) and the Constitutional Court. Although, regardless of the verdict, a part of the society will challenge it, we can safely say. This, probably, is the only right that we managed to assimilate since the 90's onward. Even if we had only the contesting spirit, it would still be worth it to wander, more than a quarter of a century, through the scruffy of the democracy. And the fact that people stupidly have failed to assert even this right, it inspires us confidence and optimism.</p>\r\n<p>Who, however, had to win and who to lose, effectively, in this election? If the answer is in front of us. But let us not hurry. The politics is an issue much more complicated than some imagine. If, in the everyday life, when one loses the other, most often wins in politics, on the contrary, the victory can turn into failure and from defeat may be taken advantages. The politics also recognizes situations when all are losers, but also cases when everybody wins. It depends on how you think and how it works. Advantaged are those who look on. Ergo: let's not reduce failures thr cause of at fraud the invocation of until satiety, but we must try, each after power to change things. The action is preferable  to moan (for which neither those who still practice it, no longer have ears).</p>\r\n<p>As mentioned, the presidential result was, from the outset, almost known. PD, the leading party in the current ruling coalition, trying probably, to anticipate events, decided to implement a scheme which took many by surprise. In the first stage, the Democrats withdrew their candidate from the race, then decided to relieve the duties of the president, still quite modest. This time (it can be said as surely) the government will have by its side everyone who is dissatisfied with the eventual victory of Igor Dodon. Even those who, until recently, were demanding the head of Plahotniuc. As it may be painful for some, it must be recognized that the PD is currently the only political force that can actually thwart the plans of the socialists perched at the presidency.</p>\r\n<p>The presidential elections passed. Soon we will find out the decision of the Constitutional Court on the validation of the election. But we will never know, as it turns out, how many votes would be taken Marian Lupu, how many citizens living abroad were not able to vote and, the essentials, to what movie Igor Dodon wanted to invite Maia Sandu?...</p>\r\n<p>Too bad, though, that the PAS leader refused multiple and insistent invitations of the Socialist leader. It could be the only feasible thing in all the electoral chatter. The Cherry on the top of the cake of a campaign that has left us with a bitter taste.</p>\r\n<p> </p>",

                "lead": "Igor Dodon was elected president by universal vote on November 13. After nearly a month, besides some statements and interviews, the newly elected has gone already into oblivion and irrelevance. Show must go on, politics are developing, visits are conducted, the power and the opposition is facing in the Parliament, but Dodon no longer exists. Unless, perhaps through tirades and diatribes against the Minister of Defense and by the temptation to insinuate himself in the PL party politics, on the verge of splitting.",
                "Continut": "<p>Indeed, with the lapse of the month and extension of appeals to the mandate that he would take over, put the new elected president to the retention and into oblivion. Not less true is that the formula of approach to the political realities that he practiced was rather blunt, on positions of affray and superiority - with the Government, the Parliament, with the Romanian President - which is why the honorable one has gone into a veritable quarantine. He was to Moscow, but as a simple pedestrian, although he is expected to sign what he has already agreed with the government in intergovernmental commission. A gift of respect and desire to potentate: at the table with Putin. He did not came to Brussels and he will possibly do it later: <em>after</em> the Prime Minister Filip, <em>after</em> the arrival of the European funds for projects and <em>after</em> the signing and validating the opening of the NATO liaison office, made by Dodon a target for scandal (although he wastes his breath, with a rather diplomatic and civil representation that has Georgia, Azerbaijan, Ukraine and even Russia, along with military representation!...).</p>\r\n<p>As for Romania, there isn't even an invitation to validate the triad of symbolic visits that he will end it in Bucharest, a triad launched with a bang as his own program. And the failure comes just because his location in the bilateral issues has not yet overcome the positions of identity affray and respect of his own citizens and their options, rather of Romanian citizens. And that while the President Timofti spoke with his Romanian counterpart on the phone and received the highest Romanian distinction, the Romania's Star in rank of Collar, which not has only the incumbent President and National Bank Governor (as a accumulation of numerous decorations \"Romanian Star\" with varying successive degrees, received in the last 26 years as long as he has this position). </p>\r\n<p>Neither internally things are not the most spectacular. One by one, the parliament is passing the reforms demanded by the IMF, the World Bank and the EU, and the laws and end up being promulgated until he takes over his function. The pension reform and the pension age increase - passed in first reading, the Government and civil service reform - on the road, the ANRE independence and the establishment of the price for energy products on the market - ongoing, after signing the memorandum. And others are coming as well.</p>\r\n<p>In another plan, the prerogatives that would have incidence with the position of the President is melting and it integrates <em>in the real thine of the function in a parliamentary republic</em>. The SPP goes under the Government, as it should be. I think that soon will be missing and the last few elements in the relationship space of the President with SIS and the Chief of Staff General or the Defense Minister, and if the symbolic item linked to the Supreme Council for Security and Defense (however consultative) goes to the Government, <em>the President remains simply the State representative and he will sign whatever the Government tells and what the parliamentary majority votes</em>... He may refuse the appointments only once. The Attorney General is already bought, until Dodon will step into the residence of the President.</p>\r\n<p>Directly elected, with substantial legitimacy, Igor Dodon was closer than expected to lose the confrontation in front of Maia Sandu, who ran without anything, but took 48%. Despite the disparity of resources, of organization, political force, without the involvement of Romania in elections - the promotion of signals to come to vote, namely covering the journey by train is in Chapter goodwill and participation support, does not fall in the actions of interference - but with massive involvement of Russia in the runoff - which paid and traveled with an order 19,000 inhabitants from Transnistria to vote for Dodon, plus the teams of organizations which walked the villages one by one in northern Moldova with lies about Syrians that are occupying the houses of those who left the country with the consent of Maia Sandu, or the gossips about the alleged students who have committed suicide because the former education Minister did not let them cheat on the baccalaureate, by providing them cameras. We add the Balti Diocese of the Russian Orthodox Church, which has damned Maia Sandu, because she is barren and she did not has a family and children, preferring a career, and they campaigned for Dodon open. Kind a lot of resources for such an outcome! Let's count only the posters and the billboards, and the expense is not justified!</p>\r\n<p>Up next, the old Christmas and the New Year. Somewhere around here will submit Dodon oath, that if not in the New Year's Eve will talk as well the President Timofti, a supreme gesture of defiance for the newly elected.</p>\r\n<p>Next, the old holidays, which ends after the Epiphany and Saint John by 21 January. That is still one month or so when no one has time for Dodon. With such and such a program break, the new president will take over the mandate completely irrelevant, with marginal public support and forgotten by most of us. And the urge that PSRM received through the election victory will completely melt before then. Unless, of course, a whole myriad of Socialist MPs will leave the boat to join the current government that they followed already for a long time.</p>\r\n<p>Now that's an electoral surprise! And Dodon also gave quickly his resignation from the party, losing a valuable tribune for political expression, and even brought Zenaida Greceanâi from home, to show how strong he is and he is put on great deeds! A lesson for those with excessive behavior and disregard of the rules of the game and the status of the President!</p>",

                "lead": "The President Vladimir Putin signed the new concept of foreign policy of Russia. It is the fourth such document issued by Russia, and from the general tests, both from 2000 (before September 11), from 2008 (one month before the Russian-Georgian war) as well as the one from 2013 (before the annexation of Crimea and the military aggression in eastern Ukraine), have been shown obsolete in less than a year. The same premises is kept in the current document, considering that the document implied Hillary Clinton's victory in the US presidential election, but the victorious one was Donald Trump.",
                "Continut": "<p>There is a sensible level of latest correction of the current Foreign Policy Concept, most likely due to its phases of approval to the Russian Foreign Ministry, the National Security Council and the President Putin. This correction relevant stresses a caution in relation to the new US President, which we find also in the speech of Vladimir Putin about the state of the nation and, most likely, we will find it in his annual press conference from December 21 to 22. This is about the temptation of tinting and reducing criticism in the hope for a different approach by Donald Trump of the bilateral relations.</p>\r\n<p>This prudent approach has failed, however, to blur the blunt general features of Russia's relationship with the West, already different compared to its position from 2013. If Russia would integrate back in the time into the global community and would consider itself a part of Europe, this time the two components have disappeared and remained only the feature confrontational of the relationship: the US is a threat to Russia's national security - for the first time since the cold war, in line with the military doctrine; through the attempts to limit Russia, the EU and the US undermines the regional and global stability; and \"the geopolitical expansion\" of the EU is criticized amply.</p>\r\n<p>Instead, the concept of foreign policy comes to speak about the restoration of Russia as a superpower, \"strengthening Russia's position as one of the most influential centers of power in the modern world\" who wants \"to strengthen the factor of force at the international relations level\", ie the use of military force. The illusion of superpower and the Russian exceptionalism promoted by the Concept of foreign policy translates, in fact, the faith to Russia that the use of military force can make to come out of isolation and to oblige the whole world to accept its claims, thus managing to impose their policies, vision and interests on the the global arena. In addition, the Kremlin is trying to present its military intervention in Syria, to suggest that the world can not solve this crisis without Russia.</p>\r\n<p>The concept of foreign policy of this year, through its unshaded political side after the election of Trump as US president, but as a result of technical assessments, is, in fact,<strong> a true doctrine of the Cold War</strong>, placing again Russia and the West in opposition, and even on the position of the absolute enemy. Even the recourse to multi-polarization is nothing more than a coverage of desire to achieve the position of bipolarity with the US and the resumption of business by negotiating with the US, a <strong>strong negotiation, in agreement by constant threats of recourse to nuclear weapons</strong>. </p>\r\n<p>The Kremlin blames, constantly, the West and its alleged expansion, pleading for spheres of influence and limited sovereignty by its own interests in the post-Soviet space, otherwise announcing the imminence of the war. But it does not think at any point that the solution in terms of current principles of respect for sovereignty, territorial integrity and independence of the States and that its problems can be solved by substantially reducing its level of ambition and the cessation of military expansion, inclusively of alternative forms of recovering by force of the USSR. Otherwise, the collapse, of economic reasons, of the State is imminent.</p>\r\n<p>The document reaffirms the doctrinal provisions from 2013, from the same concept, relative to the good soft power of Russia against the evil of the West, however, moving the discussion to<strong> the informational war</strong> level. One of the most important goals of Russian foreign policy is, <strong>\"strengthening the position of Russian media in the global information space\"</strong>. In Europe, the policy of transatlantic division and the internal division is present, even in the nomination of the partner states: Italy, France, Germany, Spain, not the UK, the Netherlands or Finland, the last one being deleted as well from the discussion on the relationship with the Nordic countries. In rest are kept the false propagandist references to respect the international obligations in good faith, or those contradictory ones: the opposition against the aggressive nationalism but supporting as an absolute priority the Russian World concept.</p>",

                "lead": "I never thought I would ever get to write this editorial. I have always had respect for politicians and political work because I lived and still live in this world, I see and understand how it works. I help and advise politicians for decades, but I do not know how to do politics myself and, therefore, I always respect those who can to do what I am not able to do. However, I am an analyst, I see and know multiple experiences in multiple states, more or less democratic, and in the case of Moldova, I know the protagonists for over 27 years, which makes me have a certain fondness for the actors on this stage, whoever they are.",
                "Continut": "<p>Secondly, I did not ever write about the Liberal Party (PL) because it was a pro-Romanian party par excellence, despite ambitions and stubbornness of its leader, which are not always justified and never constructive. In addition, today the level of support is so small that even an editorial is not justified, only if an exceptional thing  happened or a requiem on the eve of the funeral...</p>\r\n<p>As for the number one protagonist, Mihai Ghimpu that is a character, no matter who analyzes him. He was acting president and based his gestures and interests on the Romanians on both sides of the Prut. He played his part in the history of the last quarter-century. I know the less exposed, but more known and important brother of his, Gheorghe Ghimpu, God rest his soul in peace, a true hero and leader of the Romanian resistance in Bessarabia, the leader of the national resistance party.</p>\r\n<p>However, the evolution of the last months and especially the last days forced me to lean on this ruling Liberal party, which launched its own candidate for president, the party chairman, who collected 1.8% of votes in the first round and kept the explanation of this situation close. Besides, PL is in a blockage for years, by avoiding to mark a succession in the party at least for Chisinau mayor, Dorin Chirtoaca, in the previous cycle, when he had credibility and more relevant support.</p>\r\n<p>Now comes the discussion about the dispute and withdrawal of the political support of Anatol Salaru. The only PL minister with visibility and relevance, an extremely important ministry for Euro-Atlantic integration (on a PL program to join NATO) and with certain achievements in this field. Not the only one, not unique, but relevant throughout his mandate. While in other cases, the National Anti-Corruption Center and the Anti-Corruption Prosecutor's Office walks in the yard of other PL ministers or near them, when neither the mayor Chirtoaca does not seem to feel too good. When the signals in this matter were consistent, to sacrifice the only driver for the image due to selfish and individualistic reasons is already a major political loss. Not to say that we speak about the actions of a party that has not passed the threshold in polls for a long time...</p>\r\n<p>But, perhaps the most complicated issue is that Mihai Ghimpu <em>dies ugly</em>, from a political point of view. He commits suicide. He is the last of the Mohicans who clings to an ephemeral position where he looses the last percents of his party out of ambition.</p>\r\n<p>The simplest suicide formula for a political leader is to not admit the guilt for the defeats in electoral campaigns or political projects that you declare. At the European level, there are no exceptions. Those who force things in a democracy lose the esteem of their relatives and party members, not to mention the adversaries and partners. That's because they prove that could not lose. </p>\r\n<p>In Romania, Crin Antonescu has resigned along with the deputy president of PNL then Iohannis for not reaching the percentage forecasted as a target in the European Parliament elections. Alina Gorghiu left immediately after a small result in the elections with all the PNL leadership and the heads of branches that failed. In Italy, Renzi left because his constitutional reform was rejected by voters in a referendum. Everywhere in democracy the defeat leads to the withdrawal of the party leader who failed, precisely to give his successor a chance to go further. Even in Chisinau, Marian Lupu, PDM president withdrew, freeing the way for a renewal of the party, although he did not get to vote in the first round.</p>\r\n<p>In Bucharest, the PNL leadership was taken over by the President of the best branch, as well as the position of Secretary General of the Party. This was a temporary action until the organization of theNational Convention and elections in the Congress. Raluca Turcan in Alba and Marian Petrache in Ilfov performed and took over the responsibilities of the defeated ones. In Italy, Gentiloni took over from Renzi. The party and the government go further. In France, Hollande has decided not to run, Sarkozy withdrew from political life after he was defeatead by Alain Juppe. The rule is maintained around the world because voters do not love both defeated ones and those who cling to power in any form, and a leader defeated in a battle acquires easily the label of a loser, which you cannot ever remove from blood .</p>\r\n<p>After a score of 1.8%, Mihai Ghimpu had to resign. Well, he had to withdraw from the party leadership in recent local elections and leave Dorin Chirtoaca as chairman, because he had a higher confidence rating than him. Vlad Filat made the same mistake at PLDM, leaving Iurie Leanca unused as driver of the party even if he had a higher rating. Today the role of PL locomotive could be taken only by Anatol Salaru as much as he could do it under the current circumstances. To kill your best horse to try to keep yourself in the race is a political infantilism and proof of a lack in the sense of reality. One again: <em>Mihai Ghimpu dies ugly from a political suicide</em>.</p>\r\n<p>The issue is whether the current coalition will continue to take a walking dead and with no chance of expansion as a partner instead of a good and efficient minister. In addition, with issues of corruption in protected ministries. And if yes due to circumstantial reasons, for how long? Because <em>Mihai Ghimpu's gesture buries the coalition and strengthens an European right opposition of Maia Sandu.</em></p>",

Seems like yesterday the party was emanating vitality and optimism, and now is lying on the domestic politics bench, with lighted candles to an end.",
                "Continut": "<p>Although there are various causes and reasons that have milled the health, eroded the vigor and squeezed the life out of the deceased, the politological autopsy to which have been examined the bodies, shows that almost all were permanently destroyed by a hard and incurable disease - the eternal leader syndrome.</p>\r\n<p><em><strong>Features:</strong></em> the virus attacks the mind of the party leader, who, by identifying himself with the founding father or Messiah, he builds himself a cult of personality, he believes he is eternal, omnipotent, infallible and therefore irreplaceable.</p>\r\n<p><em><strong>Effects:</strong></em> a political party, sooner or later finds its political end in the grip of an obsessed leader that at the beginning is full of tenderness and sweetness, then smothering and fatal.</p>\r\n<p>The virus is transmitted by politicians, mostly it attacks the political parties, and the adverse consequences are borne by the society.</p>\r\n<p>The incubation period varies from case to case, but, as a rule, it is activated with the accession to government.</p>\r\n<p>All this takes place under the eyes, at first enthusiastic and combative, and then apathetic and powerless of thousands of members and supporters. In time, they opt for the status of \"former\", but prefer not to display the relationship.</p>\r\n<p>The political death, however, does not occur suddenly. As the embrace of the leader is more feverish, the party gives its spirit faster. But anyway, the agony is still present, while the leader is lamenting, often even is delirious.</p>\r\n<p>More recently, the political leader's death may be hastened by the courts, in the sentences of which is written with uppercase: CORRUPTION. The leader claims the fact that this is about political revenge, he victimize himself. The most devoted are hanging to him as for the last chance for political survival, and together they go to the bottom, taking with them and the hopes of many from sometime.</p>\r\n<p>The former party leader can return quickly enough in the public life. Now he suffers from amnesia.</p>\r\n<p>This time, he appears more often in other ways: a moralizing expert in stasiology (sociological study or politologycal of political parties) or if he had the chance and successfully failed a domain, by occupying a high public office, then he sees himself useful for the society and shares his experience in front of a motivated audience or cameras.</p>\r\n<p>No remorse! No repentance, no way!</p>\r\n<p>And so on, since 1990, 26 years beaten on the edge...</p>",

                "lead": "The elected President of the Republic of Moldova, Igor Dodon, has stated more clearly his positions, his beliefs and his views around the world, already in the position of the validated President by the Constitutional Court, even if he did not yet took the office. Dodon believes that Moldova faces directly Romania and the Russian Federation, in an interview for Russia Today, he forgets his role of an independent and a defender of Moldovan citizens and place himself directly by the Russian side, thinking that he clearly is at war with Romania, but also with his own State.His main topics, where he contradicts himself and he destroys his own strategies of his government and all previous governments of Moldova (including those to which he belonged) are limiting of the sovereignty on the altar of Russia and the federalization of the State in favor of the separatist region, actually in favor of the same Russia.",
                "Continut": "<p>Firstly, by criticizing the high number of scholarships offered generously by Romania to the young people from Moldova, Igor Dodon says that <em>\"They ]Romania, editor's note] come very aggressive. And the education of the children, and the civil society. But we how answer them? Only with beautiful words? Like this we will not succeed. For now, we keep strong, we keep the Moldovan statehood, very often on enthusiasm and because we have the same roots ]with Russia editor's note]\".</em></p>\r\n<p>So there's no doubt, Dodon sees everything in \"they\" and \"us\". \"Them,\" others, are Romania, Romanians, those who give a lot of scholarships. \"We\", \"us\", are Russia, Dodon and his Russians and those who stand up to \"Romania who are coming very aggressive\" and resist only with enthusiasm because Russia does not give scholarships and aid like Romania. Of course \"the Moldovan statehood\" is just a puppet, because, according to Dodon, the Republic of Moldova and Russia, Russian citizens and those from Moldova, have the same Russian roots (or maybe Soviet?) So the worship of the sovereignty to the Russians, because they are the same people is good, but the Romanian scholarships are the expression of aggression!</p>\r\n<p>But let's see how sees the newly elected President of the Republic of Moldova the enemy, the opponent, the scarecrow Romania. Igor Dodon believes that the provision of scholarships to young students, master and doctoral students on behalf of Romania is a policy of \"Romanization\". The union and the Romanization are obsessions Dodon's, to which the returns when he is speaking with the Russian media, when he let go of his feelings that otherwise he paints or nuances them in the interviews with local media in Moldova or with the Romanian media. He urged Russia to do more to stop the Romanization, including by offering of an extended number of scholarships to young Moldovans.</p>\r\n<p>Also, Igor Dodon is proving to be a real supporter of Russian informational warfare in the Republic of Moldova, whose exponent he is. Thus, instead of being concerned with Moldova's sovereignty over its area of information, because 80% of news and information in audiovisual media are produced in Moscow, a percentage of impact and audience, Igor Dodon wants to implement more initiatives like \"Izborsk Club\" (informative pro-Russian platform) agreed by personalities and \"experts\" imported from Russia.</p>\r\n<p>In Conclusion, limited sovereignty, if it’s possible – the elimination of anybody who has ideas or says the NATO name, even if it’s about a contact and civil dialog center which exists already in Russia itself. To outlaw the Unionists, because they are Moldovan citizens, who have a certain way of thinking, a thing that is guaranteed by the Constitution but which is not agreed by the Socialist leader, the next President. And the citizens with double citizenship to be thrown out of the country, if the second citizenship is Romanian. Cause I didn’t heard such claims about the Russian second citizenship.</p>\r\n<p>Finally, the second scandalous topic for the whole history of Moldova since the independence of the state, or even during the birth of national liberation movement, 1988, onwards, the relationship with the separatist Transnistrian region. The withdrawal of the Russian troops and weapons, disappeared, naturally, from the speech of the Presidency - a new reverence to the President Timofti, whom many will regret if they do not regret it already - instead, the elected President Dodon said that Moldova should apologize to Transnistria for the 1992 war! Why not to Russia? Cause its troops have orchestrated and won the separatist conflict on the Dniester against Moldovan state, whose chairman is now, Igor Dodon.</p>\r\n<p>According to Dodon, the conflict broke out only because of Moldova, because Moldova wanted the unification with Romania. \"First of all, it is the fault of Moldova, I recognize this. Several times I said that we must acknowledge this fact and apologize for the deaths of hundreds, thousands of citizens,\" said Dodon. So, the maximum ineptitude against its own people: the option of independent Moldovan citizens, affirmed sovereignly is guilty, not the Russian occupation troops and starting the war against the independent state for seize and control of a breakaway territory, with pretense to the state, by maintaining an oasis of Soviet Stalinism in Tiraspol, artificially, on Russian money and with the presence of the Russian army. So much for the President that will be installed in Chisinau tomorrow!</p>\r\n<p>It is certain that Igor Dodon announces troubled and confrontational times in his relationship with Romania. The idea of Romanian brothers and a visit to Bucharest disappeared, now, the new president is preparing for isolation from its own population. And to fight against his own people, which he wants to throw out of public office and to outlaw them for crime of opinion. He is violating flagrantly the guarantor of the Constitution, by ignoring the human rights, the constitutional provisions and especially by ignoring the Declaration of Independence of the State that he will lead, a document that he never invoked and which establishes the state language as Romanian, a thing noted by the Constitutional Court already, none other than the institution that will enshrine him as the President of the Republic of Moldova!</p>\r\n<p>Complicated times are announced, we got lucky that the role of the President became decorative. And by keeping Igor Dodon on that position, it isolates him not only of Romania, of civilization, of society, but even his own citizens.</p>",

                "lead": "During the Extraordinary Congress of PSRM, the delegates adopted a resolution on the steps to be made by the party leadership starting with 2017. The document fully avoids the report to the national interest of the Republic of Moldova or to the defining documents of the Republic of Moldova - the Declaration of Independence, the Constitution, the Law of special status of districts in Eastern Moldova and the Law for Moldova's European option. The Laws were passed unanimously by the Parliament in 2005, when President was the communist Vladimir Voronin.",
                "Continut": "<p>After stating their support for the newly elected President of the Republic of Moldova, Igor Dodon, and thanking him, the members of the Congress voted several relevant resolutions, worth being watched.</p>\r\n<p><strong>The win of political power and early elections in 2017</strong></p>\r\n<p>\"For the achievement of the program documents of the Party, the Programme of development of the country, the concept of federalization of Moldova and other fundamental documents, Socialists consider appropriate to trigger, in the shortest time, early parliamentary elections. PSRM says it will not work with the current oligarchic regime and will not form coalitions with parties in the current government. PSRM will make every effort for early parliamentary elections to take place in 2017 and will do everything possible to win the them, so that they could form the leadership of the new Parliament and the new Government of the country.\"<strong></strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>„The dis</strong><strong>oligarchization</strong><strong>” of the Republic of Moldova</strong></p>\r\n<p> \"PSRM reconfirms <strong>the course towards the disoligarchisation of Moldova</strong>. We are for <strong>the revision of illegal privatization results, for the nationalization of assets obtained fraudulently, the repossession under the State of the Chisinau International Airport and of Banca de Economii</strong>. We support <strong>the principle of \"presumption of corruption\" in relation to civil servants and the lustration of the officials accused of corruption. </strong>The refund of the billions should not be an obligation of the citizens, but of state criminals who have committed \"the theft of the century\".</p>\r\n<p><strong>PSRM condemns the deliberate delay of the validation of the results of the presidential elections and sworning in of the President of the country, Mr. Igor Dodon, made to perform anti-state actions and approve a number of antisocial laws, including those relating to the increasing of the retirement age, the increase of utility tariffs, the appointment of the prosecutor general, the opening of the NATO Liaison Office. PSRM will make every effort and use all its levers to cancel these laws.</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>The prohibition of unionism and of the History of Romanians</strong></p>\r\n<p>PSRM declares itself a supporter of Moldova's statehood; it demands the ban of ideology of unionism and of organizations that stand for Moldovan liquidation of the statehood. PSRM supports the reintroduction into the school curriculum of discipline \"History of Moldova\". PSRM strongly supports Moldova's course towards neutrality.<strong> </strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>The reopening of the \"Stability Pact\" box</strong></p>\r\n<p>In 2003, at the beginning of his term, Vladimir Voronin demanded the creation of a stability pact and obtaining guarantees for the neutrality of Moldova. PSRM now comes with new claims of this kind, only the guarantees are changed: first Russia, then USA, EU and China. A quadrilateral formula. In which Russia and China would balance the US and EU. Not even the format of the UN Security Council members, from the variant of the Budapest Pact in 1994, of integrating Ukraine into the Non-Proliferation Treaty, the transfer of nuclear weapons to Russia against the guarantees of sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity. I have seen the impact and the validity of such guarantees when the territorial mutilation is done by one of the signatories.</p>\r\n<p>The document and the principle is a complete utopia, not to mention that it's about a useless document, which has already demonstrated its irrelevance in other cases. To ask the big powers to come to your feet and to guarantee you the neutrality claimed by constitution is an unrealistic approach, dreamy, even if it is inspired by Moscow again. In international relations, such guarantees cost majorly. Plus that, the neutrality is an exceeded principle in a world where the confrontation of fault is specified, especially since the state concerned is situated geographically between military and political blocks.</p>\r\n<p>The resolution also says that \"PSRM supports the President of Moldova in his intentions to obtain the signing, with the participation of Russia, USA, EU and China, of a multilateral pact regarding the guarantee of the neutrality of the status of Moldova. PSRM is categorically against any form of NATO's presence in Moldova.\"<strong> </strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>Neutrality but integration into the Euro-Asian Union</strong></p>\r\n<p>PSRM wants to change the strategic vector of Moldova and to redirect the whole economical and trading formula to the East, towards the integration structures of Moscow, after that it wishes the breaking of the EU Association Agreement. The document states:</p>\r\n<p>\"PSRM is a supporter of Moldova's accession to the Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU) and the termination of the Association Agreement with the European Union. PSRM believes that only in the EAEU composition is possible the full recovery of Moldovan products on the Eurasian market, may be signed agreements on long-term gas prices for Moldova and can be obtained safeguards for being a Moldovan migrant worker in Russia and other countries of EAEU. Only in EAEU can be restarted the economic links, the resumption of Moldovan industry and the creation of tens of thousands of well-paid jobs in our country. \"</p>\r\n<p>\"Starting with 2017, the party will initiate projects and joint programs with cities and regions of other countries, primarily the Russian and Eurasian countries.\"</p>\r\n<p><strong>Moldova's federalization, on both sides, and the rejection of the counties</strong></p>\r\n<p>The document also states that \"PSRM is against devastating «administrative-territorial reform», which provides the liquidation of districts and the return to the counties.\"    </p>\r\n<p>On the other hand, \"PSRM supports the course for creating a democratic federative state on both sides of Dniester.\" The option is unique and contrary to all the projects and integration strategies of Moldova and <em>it validates the federalization and the transnistrization</em> on the left side of Prut, namely the introduction of limited sovereignty formulas for the State from the left side of Prut.</p>\r\n<p>The decision of the Congress also states that \"PSRM is the only party that has a concrete plan to reunify the country and to build a common state on both banks of Dniester.\" Moreover, it returns to the 1997 Primakov project, the pre-existence of two political entities that perform the \"common state\": \"The party will focus on working with the politicians and civil society from Transnistria within the project \"Two sides - a single space,\" which will start in the beginning of 2017.\" This provides the recognition in a pre-existence formula of the \"Transnistria partner\" to have someone to sign this joint state constitution.</p>\r\n<p><em>All these resolutions collide directly with everything that the Republic of Moldova did throughout its independence period</em>. In addition, it creates a fault with the current parliamentary majority and the current Government. Furthermore, the claim to generate early elections in 2017 becomes a major problem of constitutionality and process, once there is a parliamentary majority and stable government.<strong><em> The option of PSRM emphasizes once again the need of establishment of joined forces of the right pro-European wing, and the coherent movement of Maia Sandu is already required to rebalance the pro-Western, pro-European option of Moldova.</em></strong></p>",

                "lead": "One might say that I've given too much attention to Igor Dodon. Yes I did. Anyway, I promised that I will abandon fully the analysis of domestic politics in Moldova, leaving it to the colleagues who are better placed to comment on what is happening in Chisinau, in the political show. Anyway the major issues have been launched already, the trends are known, we only expect the clashes and the achievements of the expected scenarios.",
                "Continut": "<p>Yet, we could not conclude the saga of the takeover of the President office by Igor Dodon with the aberration carried out by a president who does not recognize his own state. Who denies the Moldovan <em>Declaration of Independence</em>, the state where he was elected President! In addition, the pinnacle, as a first step when he reached the presidency, even on Christmas Eve, he is replacing the Romanian language on \"Moldovan language\" on the web site of the president. By politicizing from the beginning the identity, history, language, i.e. topics he would have had to leave to the specialists, experts, historians (who have already pronounced themselves).</p>\r\n<p>There were others who fought with the Romanian language and the Romanian identity of the Moldovan citizens. As well as with the <em>Romanian history</em>. The agrarians of Motpan and the socialists of Solonari and Shornikov did it in 1994, when they launched <em>Our Home Republic of Moldova</em> and  resumed the Soviet theory of outgoing Moldovenism of Artiom Lazarev, in 1975, not to mention about the Stalinist one in 1924. Then the theory of Vladimir Voronin with the famous <em>Concept of National Policy</em> was resumed and placement of the Romanians in Moldova as the sixth nationality! </p>\r\n<p>Whatever, there is no point to talk here about the aberrations and the perceptions of those who say that they are Moldovans: the majority are Moldovans i.e. Romanians, so the regional identity is Moldovan, like the brothers from the right side of Prut, and the national one is Romanian. And they do not mix it!</p>\r\n<p>Then another important part is identifying themselves as Moldovan, but statalists, because they live in Moldova, not that they are another nation. And those, so-called ethnic Moldovans, who even claim that they are of the family of Slavic people (another aberration of an obsolete and retrograde branch of Moldovenism) are in a ridiculous minority besides others. <em>Also the conciliatory solution of the majority of Romanians / Moldovans, who identify themselves alternately on cultural grounds, but with a synonym of absolute identity, is the only one that can lead to an acceptable compromise for a President of all the citizens of Moldova.</em></p>\r\n<p>I had such a discussion with Igor Dodon in 2003-2004, when he just embraced the Moldovenism theory. I told him, back then, to leave the identity problems and to deal with the economy, because there he might even be good. We had a joint panel at the European School of Viorel Cibotaru when we pointed out the same aberrations and the need to leave the topics of such invoice for a serious politician. I see that the tips have not been listened up at that time, or were forgotten under the virtue of access to power.</p>\r\n<p>The return to such complex topics and sensitive for the society are doing nothing but to take Igor Dodon out from the trail of Moldovan president and make him, at the most, the Chairman of his party or of his voters strictly. Although in the campaign he did not say anything about the removal of the Republic of Moldova from the Association Agreement with the EU, and he even  said that he wants to make a visit to Brussels, and I do not know if an announced referendum will bring him ever the satisfaction or will end the subject of eternal strategic realignment of Moldova to Russia and the return to the Empire.</p>\r\n<p>Another utopia was shattered on the occasion of his enthronement and the late visit of Dmitry Rogozin to Chisinau. The idea of a gentle bullock that is sucking of two cows, was definitely compromised and removed from the illusions and the idealism of Dodon. Rogozin said unequivocally that the good relations with Russia, claimed by Dodon as the goal of his presidency, can be achieved only by breaking the EU Association Agreement, therefore by separation from the EU and cold relations to West.</p>\r\n<p>What Rogozin did not say and Dodon avoids to say, is that the proximity to Russia transforms Moldova into a pro-Russian enclave in the middle of a large pro-Western structure. Because Moldova is at the frontier of NATO and EU, and it is isolated to the other side by Russia through its second neighbor, Ukraine, equally unhappy with the declarative outflows of the new president of Moldova about Crimea placed in the Russian trail. And the <em>improvement of the relations with Russia cannot be made against the good relations with Ukraine!</em></p>\r\n<p>We do not discuss here the component of prosperity, free trade and good neighborliness that Moldova would sacrifice. Not even the aberration to federalization of the breakaway region where the representative of local business won precisely because he wishes the integration into the European market, where is exported the most of industrial production of Moldova, located in Transnistria. But I think is worth to be mentioned here another problem: the free movement.</p>\r\n<p>At the last European Council in Brussels and at the last EU Council on Justice and Domestic Affairs, to allow the ratification of the EU-Ukraine agreement by the Netherlands and thus the ratification of the agreement across the EU, was approved the formula and the conditions to accelerate the introduction of visas for the countries which do not meet their commitments, the game rules or send too many migrants to work in Europe. The direct result for Moldova? Dodon's game of hide-and-seek with the EU and the Association Agreement, his excessive identity approaches, if they become policies in Moldova, it may result in suspension of free movement in the EU and even the cancellation of those facilities. <strong><em>This must be understood by the Moldovan citizens: that the cancellation of the Association Agreement with the EU, and even previously, inappropriate and unfriendly gestures against the EU, may invalidate the free movement in the EU. Throughout the EU, including Romania.</em></strong></p>\r\n<p>What does that mean in terms of remittances and supporting Moldova? I leave you to guess... But in all kinds of aid? And who takes the weight of supporting Moldova? Russia? Vladimir Socor wrote these days: Russia is unable to support today's political projects, not even the Transnistrian breakaway region, nor the entire Moldova! And this play with Dodon will cost a lot. Those citizens who did not go to the polls, those who were unhappy with his rival, Maia Sandu, those who have tolerated the pro-Russian socialist as the President of Moldova. And it's just the beginning of a presidential term into which either Igor Dodon enters into irrelevance, or he blows up and sends the state into ceasing of Payments. And he will not come from home with money to solve the major problems of the Moldovan economy.</p>",

                "lead": "Two major events have marked the past week, between New Year and Christmas in the Gregorian calendar: hyper-activism, assertiveness, voluntarism and desire to be in the forefront of the new president Igor Dodon and the message sent to Fox News by the newly elected president of the Democratic Party, Vladimir Plahotniuc, addressed to the new US president Donald Trump, before taking the office. A paid message. These two elements come to mark the most important topic of how, in fact, can cooperate Russia with the West in a post-Soviet state, with Moldova as a test case.",
                "Continut": "<p>However, let's take them one by one. Firstly, Igor Dodon, in a drunkenness of excess communication, makes mistake after mistake, marking the position of a pro-Russian president, supported by Moscow, but wittingly undermining his own state and national policies. After a highly dubious statement of contesting the Declaration of Independence of the Republic of Moldova, his reactions in relation to the breakaway region and challenging the existing laws and documents, strategy and approach of the breakaway region creates major difficulties of consistency for Moldova. He announces debates but not winnings. All of this for the benefit of Moscow, although he stubbornly affirms he is a \"pro-Moldovan\" president, not a pro-Russian one.</p>\r\n<p>Perhaps the worst option is addressing the need to ensure neutrality. The idea of guarantees for neutrality at the UN Security Council level or other <em>ad hoc</em> formulas by major powers is another abberation nthrough which Moscow has tried more than once (see Voronin's similar attempt) to gain advantages. However, the international neutrality recognized and guaranteed involves resources and costs or pre-existing international interests that Moldova doesn't have and cannot attract.  Especially, from the geographical position on the edge of Europe, on the fault line, between the border of NATO and EU on Prut and Ukraine, which aspires the West path and is at war with Russia in Crimea and Donbas. A utopia, ignorance of the realities, just open opportunities for Moscow, for Putin's Russia, asked by Chisinau to take steps in this regard, even if they have no perspective. However, it makes no sense to tell us how things will flow, will Dodon hit the ceiling when his emissaries will return with all the negative responses. Not to mention it's not his job, but the Government's, which was not even consulted. It's not the President's initiative, who <em>only represents the state</em> and does not make the policy, but the majority, the Government and Parliament who were not even informed. Malicious ones would say it's a classic case of launching impeachment proceedings in Parliament. It's just too early.</p>\r\n<p>The second initiative is the least interesting, aspirational, an act of foreign policy and public diplomacy in the eyes and under the nose of the new American president-elect, but all at the ideal and naive level. Saying that you want in the West without arguing with Russia is, indeed, a welcoming natural position. What do you do when Moscow says, with Rogozin's voice taken over by Dodon that for good relations with Putin's Russia Moldova must give up the Association Agreement? Not only to not have relations with NATO, and to respect Russia's interests but to give up any Western aspiration and embrace limited sovereignty in the trail of Russia. Furthermore, it reintegrates you territorially, under the control of Russian troops from Transnistria, if you are well behaved and return to Moscow's new imperial structure.</p>\r\n<p>Another point of discussion is one in which, you actually refuse to choose between East and West, because you affirm that you refuse to make new enemies. However, the approach overlooks the principle of feeding from two cows, of a good and gentle calf, that Moldova has practiced repeatedly. In addition, this principle betrays, in fact the ambiguity, avoiding the choice and the firm option in order to live on the earnings, which are coming from both sides. However, this means betraying the two competitors equally: Russia and the West. I am not talking here about the special and more complex relationship with Romania. Lack of coolness and desire to decide and choose is what will lead Moldova to its collapse, between the West's Romania and the pro-Western Ukraine.</p>\r\n<p>Finally, perhaps one less visible thing, the current situation in Moldova is a test case test case of the West's cooperation with Putin's Russia in the post-Soviet space. This comes after Moscow's aggressive manifestations in Georgia and Ukraine, and after the opening announced by US President Donald Trump to restore relations with Russia of Vladimir Putin. Chisinau is behind Ukraine, geographically, if we consider Donbas front of confrontation, so any cooperation denounce shades and clear limits to not change the reality and force of Kiev to defend itself and to defend the West against Russian aggression. We must not forget that Dodon's election as president in a parliamentary republic takes place in the context of a government majority said to be pro-European. However, if the terms of cooperation proposed by Russia are those of action and statements of Dodon, left to win this trial test, such a counter-argument will fundamentally affect any kind of cooperation between Trump's America and Putin's Russia over the area. This is because the way of expression marks exceptionalism, individualism and the desire to immediately take full power by Moscow: earlier elections, informational warfare, domination of the media, and not the cooperation with the West, without mentioning even a more complex relationship with Romania. This behavior of an actor to whom you give an inch, he will take a mile, to whom you give a mile, and he will take everything, it is unacceptable.</p>",

                "lead": "I was asked recently how do I see the relationships between Romania and Moldova in the era of the new PSD Grindeanu government and Dodon. The Chisinau press is still in the infancy of understanding the international relations and therefore each event and change of government is a matter of traditional questioning and ritual reaffirmation of good mutual relations, even if the real concern of people is less important.",
                "Continut": "<p>Why do I say this? As a democratic state, settled, sustainable, although it has its own problems and political developments, Romania does not change suddenly its foreign policy on security and defense at the change of term. It's a predictable state and its approaches are transparent and known: Romania's national interest is Moldova's European path, the closeness of Chisinau to the EU, the reforms to allow that, at the first opportunity, Moldova could enter the European body. To have rules, institutions, regulations compatible with those of Romania. The approach is affirmed and real. Any derailment from the European path creates reactions from Romania.</p>\r\n<p>As for Moldova, things are less clear. Chisinau is not the holder of an integrated European democratic state, with stable institutions, established, with functionality and institutional culture. It's still in the democratic childhood, and in terms of developed strategic focus, it is already playing between East and West, between the US / EU (with NATO in the alternative, which does not even pronounce itself because of the fear of a neutrality stated constitutionally and poorly understood) and Russia. And if over this confusion and ambiguous result, of Russian informational war with the Moldovan citizen, we also put the arrival of a pro-Russian President, Igor Dodon, in the position of a President, no matter how irrelevant and depleted of powers would be this position in a parliamentary republic, the result is an alarming one.</p>\r\n<p>So, let's return to the current matter: the arrival of  Grindeanu-PSD government does not causes changes of approach, only shades. The conditioning or not of the grant tranche (meaning giving up the preconditions by the new government), better cooperation with the Government of PDM on the principle of European social democratic fraternity with PSD, the main party in government in Bucharest, an increased interest for the Romanians worldwide, thus from Moldova as well, a topic where a Minister will handle the projects for maintaining the identity. However, at the priority level, the approach is consistent for any party that reached the Romanian government.</p>\r\n<p>If we look at the other side, Igor Dodon's manifestations are far from being friendly or his statements are not likely to encourage the bilateral cooperation. After what he stands out as pro-Russian and preaches the return to the Empire, he denies the Declaration of Independence of his own state and the decisions of the Constitutional Court of the state where he is President, and even more, he unearths the most archaic reactions of the Soviet proletkult of the 50's and brings back Moldova not even at the stage of Moldovenism from the year of 1994, with Our Home Moldova, but to Lazarev Artiom 1975, the father of the historical Moldovenism, if not even in the 1924th year, the creation of the Moldavian ASSR, with its capital in Tiraspol and the orchestration of the rebellion from Tatarbunar.</p>\r\n<p>Indeed, Igor Dodon is the great problem of the Romanian-Romanian relations between Romania and Moldova. And he should know, both the President and the Moldovan citizens should be aware, because on the same coordinates lie the relations with Ukraine or other countries. The anarchism and geopolitical fumbling or the temptation to be catchy, to milk two cows at the same time and not assume the West strategic orientation disqualifies President Dodon to approach a visit to Bucharest, and the number of conditions to make this visit increase, they do not decrease, day by day, based on scandalous allegations which he proffers in public.</p>\r\n<p>To conclude: Romania-Moldova relations will be as good as how good will be the actions of Chisinau. If Igor Dodon does not review his position, especially after his visit to Moscow, it will result in cooling the relations at this level and the preponderance of open approaches at the cooperation with the Moldovan government and pro-European majority. If here occur issues on adopting reform laws and their application, if commitments are not met, at this level there may be reserves that will unfold themselves.</p>\r\n<p>What will not miss, and even will be substantially accentuated, is the relationship with the citizens of Moldova and the support of the civil society organizations, which could amplify soon.</p>\r\n<p>So, for the Moldovan citizens, the concern should come not from the relationship with the Romania, but from the internal situation, the pro-Russian president and the government led by an oligarch, also who became a party leader, and nearly the monopolist owner of the media, who wants and supports the reforms until he will twist, and he will not be balanced by anyone, from lack of balance and subtle relationship between different branches and independent power centers of the state.</p>\r\n<p>And the concerns should cover two areas: first of all the establishment of the EU's criteria for the rapid introduction of visa, regulation required for ratification by the Netherlands of the Ukraine-EU Association Agreement, and visa liberalization for the Ukrainian citizens, but with major impact on any not member state, which does not recall home their nationals, who were caught working illegally in EU or which does not respect the EU commitments and the European states; secondly to expand the applicability of the Magnitsky law, of sanctioning in the US of those who violate human rights and are corrupt, but not only from Russia but from all countries, including Moldova, because this step can fundamentally affect the evolution and the relationship at the government level if the independence of the judiciary and fighting the indiscriminate corruption does not hit the road. Not selective justice, but justice for all, regardless of rank, especially for politicians who are in high public offices.</p>",

He must be ignored because he turns out to be a Moldovan Zhirinovsky, a Rogozin from the Bic, a politician who failed to be a news maker showman. Moreover, I believe that an alliance of media to ignore him totally, to isolate him in irrelevance and the isolation would be welcomed. That until the state institutions solve the problem of closing him in the mandate for which he did candidate. And until he gains some sense, a little more good growth and loses some nerve. However it proves that he cannot manage taking up his duties and neither the access to power and representation. Ignore, ignore, ignore and... reject!",
                "Continut": "<p>Hyperactivity, excessive voluntarism, we have a President of Moldova, Mr. Igor Dodon, as if he is plugged in and he flusters useless like a headless fly. Dissatisfied with the area of competences reserved by the current Constitution of the Republic of Moldova, Dodon does not know how to destroy it, to change it and to make room for his huge ego from here in Chisinau all the way to... Moscow. He does not even have one month after he took office and has already put everyone's nerves on the curlers just to be noticed, to show that he exists and to arrogate responsibilities that do not belong to him.</p>\r\n<p>Until changing the Constitution, until organizing a referendum, until dissolving the Parliament, until scuttling along all the Romanians from Moldova and about half of the population who did not vote for him, until removing the unionism outside the law and revoking the human rights on the left side of the Prut, shouldn't he as President in Chisinau to obey the law? To respect the Constitution? The Constitution that after which he was elected and which he sworn on, none other. And the state institutions, if Moldova wants to be seen as a serious state, shouldn't it bring him to reason, within the mandate, with the risk of resort to his dismissal? Or the costs on his own behalf are not important enough in Chisinau? There is no need for enough ways, efforts, communications to calm the general fears and to reaffirm the positions of the majority and of the Government of the Moldovan state to the foreign partners?</p>\r\n<p>Well, until looking for solutions from his lawyers, Mr. Dodon should know that any modification of the Constitution DOES NOT APPLY! Let him look the manual from the first year at law school and to learn that there is written about the principle of non-retroactivity of the law! Except the criminal law, where the most favorable law applies to any defendant, in civil and administrative law, in the constitutional law, the retroactivity of law reigns! Unless he finds a legal and constitutional channel through which he requests a referendum, to increase the prerogatives of the office of President and to pass through a popular vote the referendum (which he will lose even if he brings all the voters from Transnistria and Russia with charter planes in Chisinau!).</p>\r\n<p>The non-retroactivity of the law, Mr. Dodon, means that any constitutional change will be valid of the function - if hypothetically all Moldova has gone insane to give you the future and the state to discredit it - for the NEXT PRESIDENT of the Republic of Moldova! Not you! The current President cannot lead the Moldovan state only on the basis of existing laws and Constitution, on which he was elected! And he has sworn to defend! Oh, and so I will not forget: by respecting the Moldovan Declaration of Independence, the Constitution and especially the legislation and the attributions in force, and in particular the Constitutional Court as the supreme institution of the rule of law and its judgments. The Constitutional Court is the one who will judge you for violation of the Constitution (it already did this in terms of appointing the ministers) and which will decide the reasons for the dismissal of the President based on violation of the Constitution of Moldova.</p>\r\n<p>Otherwise, I think it leaked too much ink for Igor Dodon, a politician who is proved to have accidentally become and with too much lightness the President of Moldova, whose lightness in the public approaches disqualifies him and who consider that he has too small responsibilities as the highest official in the service of a state whose Constitution he violates, by the vote of citizens whose rights, aspirations and past he does not respect. Certainly, he managed to lose massively the public support. I expect that the latest polls will confirm how much support still has the current Moldovan President, Igor Dodon.</p>",

                "lead": "On the weekend we witnessed the revival of PPDA. Not the revival of Andrei Nastase's party, but his rebirth in a Congress and a street demonstration, once again alongside \"Our Party\" and some Socialists. Under the sway of emotion aroused by the demonstrations in Bucharest and throughout Romania, the right-wing fragmented opposition tried to climb the wave and take advantage somehow of transfer of the image from which came from television screens worldwide.",
                "Continut": "<p>The big issue is the fundamental difference between the two actions. A difference of substance, not to mention the number. Because PPDA did not announced itself neither as any movement that supports the Romanism in Chisinau (and even, in the past, it casted out from the square the unionists and instead embraced the thesis of civic Moldovenism); nor a pro-European one: in Congress they talked about rules of European type, not about integration into the EU as a target, not to mention the support of European reforms (which would require the support of at least sequentially government if not criticizing and pressing it to make more profound and faster reforms). It did not announced itself, unfortunately, not even as a movement against corruption, the sentence was not - as it was expected, logical - the support of the work of the specialized agencies and fight against corruption, but fight against so-called captive state and Vlad Plahotniuc, respectively of the current majority and forcing of early elections that are impossible to organize, even along with the pro-Russians, with the risk of overthrow the strategic direction of the state, eventually.</p>\r\n<p>But perhaps the most questionable is the comeback to the streets along with representatives of \"Our Party\" and of those from the Party of Socialists. Or such a move is suicidal for PPDA which recreates the pro-anti-oligarch front, and even makes contradictory references to President Igor Dodon: he is in Plahotniuc's pocket, however, it is expected to be launched a referendum to withdraw of assuming to the state budget the debt of one billion from banks fall. If Andrei Nastase does not know how economy works it is his problem, but for PPDA it is suicide. How can you militate against an evidence required by the IMF - which is taking people's money and cost the companies from Moldova - which is without any alternative, really?</p>\r\n<p>As for the position against Igor Dodon, Andrei Nastase was silent as a mouse regarding Dodon's statements in Moscow and Nastase does not care from what position he will criticize the majority or the Government. And the lack of response in defense of his pro-European ideas, if he has any, or those in defense of the partnership with Romania, which gave to the citizens of Moldova resources to survive in winter are - euphemistically speaking - a big dilemma. Instead, the alignment with the Socialists and the supporters of Usatii against a government that does, however, European reforms, hardly passes as a struggle with the oligarch who is keeping the state captive.</p>\r\n<p>PPDA proves that it still has complicated issues of communication, especially on the matter of options and political orientations. In terms of action, it seems frozen in its sole concern of gaining power, no matter along with whom, no matter for what purpose, only to cast out the government and the current majority. Get up, so can I sit in the chair, is the only orientation of PPDA...</p>\r\n<p>Another big problem is defined today: the initiation of actions on its own, without considering the agreements, the partnerships and the need for agglutination of the pro-European right wing from the street. It declares itself the only opposition party, forgetting that Maia Sandu won almost 48% of votes in the presidential elections in Moldovan, being close to snatch Dodon's victory. The legitimacy of a lone wolf approach, which never went through one election, is as reprehensible as that of association with the left wing pro-Russian opposition! For the credibility that is not given by the vote remains only in the imagination of Nastase, whose party colleagues ruled their sleeves because Maia Sandu did not win the presidential competition, carousing far into the day after the election.</p>\r\n<p>The return to life it is welcomed. However, on substance, PPDA has much to change and owes consistency and clear detachment of pro-Russian orientation even to its own supporters. If not, it will confuse itself politically with the left wing and will lose the electorate as soon as a formula of coherent political agglutination of right wing will appear on the public spectrum. We expect the movement of PAS and Mrs. Sandu and the appeal to the common platform of the right wing of opposition to prepare the elections on time. Consistent approaches, of content, not small apropos to marginal social policies criticized until today (like: meal vouchers) and absence from major anti-Dodon positioning, anti-return to the Russo-Soviet Empire, strategical anti-reorientation, pro-European declared.</p>\r\n<p>As for the massive protests in Romania, the ability of Romanian society was proved again, even with a fragile opposition, to defend their interests and to limit the punishable starts of a power that ignores the desire of anti-corruption or maintain unswerving the European road. Even if they were just after elections, a month after winning substantially the power, when they wanted to get out of the lines of its program and has passed an emergency ordinance which affected the fight against corruption and saved some culprits, softened the penalties or hindered the action against those outlaws, the society reacted as well through massive demonstrations and marches, obtained the repeal of the ordinance in question, bringing substantial losses to those who generated it in terms of public trust and legitimacy.</p>\r\n<p>The actual costs shall be seen in the next period, but Romania resumed its posture and the path in respecting the European values, assuming and relocation and limiting the provisions which could give birth to excesses and abuses against the rights of the defense, where it occurred, and adjusting the elements that could give birth to errors in the judiciary system. And the massive movement in the street has brought to the Romanian citizens in the country and abroad and to Romania, the pride that they are Romanians, the prestige of European country with sophisticated, mature democracy, which is able to solve its own problems and possible sideslips. That is what democracy means, the balance and the control of powers and rulers by those who are ruled.</p>\r\n<p>As lessons learned for Moldova, firstly it must be consolidated the pro-European orientation, because the comeback to Moscow and the Euro-Asian Union of Putin brings no reform, no control mechanism over the discretionary abusive power, or for combating corruption and installation of legality. After that, it must be supported, if not forced, real reforms on this path; and the majority must be pressed as weel as the government to respect the roadmaps of reforms and make real and profound reforms. Anyway, once the mechanisms are installed and the mechanism is oiled, it will do its duty to grind anyone who broke the law: to bring him to court, to confiscate his wealth illegally obtained and to put him behind bars, whoever he is, how powerful or how voted he would be. The legitimacy is secured not only by vote, but also by respecting the law and the governing cannot be done democratically, unless with <em>the public support and in the public interest</em>, not in favor of some potentates who are temporary at the helm of state or of institutionalized real power holders.</p>",

                "lead": "The symbolism plays an important role in the political battle, especially when the symbols embodies emotion and human experience, a mechanism much more important than money and pragmatic approach, mercantile, cynical. Indeed, with excitement and hope, with confidence and dedication, by sharing out of you for the common good, it can be achieved far more than from wasting money all around some mercenaries who do not believe in the goals, visions and perspectives only until they spend the received wages.",
                "Continut": "<p>Well, this was very clearly shown by the presidential election: a candidate with no chances, with financial capacity reduced to zero (at least compared to his rival the pro-Russian socialist) without media support, only with image and coagulating the hopes of the pro-European opposition, was close to defeat the conjugate mechanism of a party machinery, backed up by the intervention of the Russian Church, of the separatist voters who were sent on mission to vote under threat of unemployment, of mobilization and of Russian machinery of informational warfare, and not without a subtle support, as it is necessary for Dodon not take too much momentum, of the consecrated decision maker oligarch, the main character in the stories about the captive State of Maia Sandu's voters.</p>\r\n<p>However, contrary to expectations for the launch of a right wing platform and for marking electoral gains, Maia Sandu and her PAS disappeared in silence for months. More seriously, she does not stop to be silent. A few appearances, rather unstructured positions and by attacking insignificant, marginal and even wrong topics - meal coupons, for example - and ignoring serious placements, of force, of categorical and clear decisions, of inspiring and decisive messages that generate the coagulation of her electorate. So, that the sayings about hard work in the territory for the construction of political organizations and institutional strengthening of PAS seems a story drawn from <em>wishful thinking</em>. It does not mean that the approach is not serious and credible, only the absence of the tip of the iceberg from the public speaking raises doubts.</p>\r\n<p>There is a famous joke of the Transylvanian Romanians: a shepherd sits on the roadside guarding his sheeps. And a passerby asks him: What do you do? Do you sit and think? And shepherd answers: no, I only sit. The same here: it's hard to tell if Maia Sandu and her PAS is working quietly or is she just silent.</p>\r\n<p>Yet, people did not forget the presidential election, neither the stunt made by the candidate of the pro-European opposition - I stubbornly call it like this on the basis of the campaign that was made for her and the electorate who voted her, because Mrs. Sandu has not bothered to defend her ideas and her positions in a clear and unequivocal form, not even of those of the electorate who voted for her; on the contrary she prefers that not distinctive mixture of anti-oligarch and captive state message, which is dissolvent and pernicious in terms of identity because it does not distinguish her from other actors on the market. The IMAS survey showed a solid second place with 13%, way below those 48% in elections but over the 07-08-10% of PAS, the peak achieved in polls before the election. And if you need one more evidence, the one with whom fights, Mr.P, it does not even appear in the polls (with the risk of having 0,something%) and the amount of the ruling parties do not exceed the threshold.</p>\r\n<p>Tell me who's your opponent in order to tell you who you are and what chances do you have. If you fight with 1-3-4%, you do not nothing but to raise your opponent, even if in real life he holds a parliamentary majority and a government. On the contrary, tinting the pro-European message, or pro-reform if you snort at the idea of a European, can be auspicious. In addition, at least the survey should indicate your real enemy, Igor Dodon, at 30-32-35% with his party. Any consultant will tell that you choose the best placed enemy than you and that you build your speech to outline your distinct identity from him.</p>\r\n<p>If both players have in their speech targets Plahotniuc, Maia Sandu's chance to win is tiny, on the contrary, the nuances are harder to communicate and the position of the President of Dodon brings more visibility. It does not mean to change your attitude towards Oligarhus Maximus of Moldova, but only to look for consistent messages to increase your electoral prospects. And yes, Dodon decreases dramatically after the elections, but you can't grow on account of his blunders, hyperactivity and aberrations said by him unless you mark them, yo do not detach yourself from them, you do not underline them, showing his mistakes as is commonly believed further in the campaign, how he promised things that can not be achieved with the duties of the President, how he preaches guidelines and choices contrary to the needs and aspirations of Moldova.</p>\r\n<p>P.S. I mark here my 200th editorial written for deschide.md after I accepted the challenge to publish two texts of opinion and analysis a week, on Tuesdays and Fridays. I refer strictly to editorials written especially on Moldova, not those resumed from Evenimentul Zilei, from my blog at Adevarul or interviews given to other publications. It was a delightful experience and I think that the verb \"cutting\" sometimes keeps explicit the goodness, the bonhomie and the sake for the characters, politicians and actors in the Moldovan public that I'm talking about. I hope also, to have the strength, the capacity and the expectations of the public in a way that I would continue this enterprise further, and I also hope that no other preoccupation of comeback in the Administrative Space or some public office not to stop, for incompatibility reasons, this communication with the readers of deschide.md. Thanks to all readers for reactions, messages, congratulations and critics alike, because we are talking about those who hold positions that make the protagonists of our editorials or cause they are our simple interested readers. Thank you!</p>\r\n<p>A special reverence to the translators of the editorials in English and Russian. I think it's difficult to juggle with the paddle of composed phrases and sentences that I use in these editorials. If you read my editorials in English and Russian, please send them as well a good thought.</p>",

                "lead": "We whitnessed this week at the beginning of March, the event of reunification of the European right opposition, namely of the clan's political Maia Sandu. I say political clan because we are talking about a series of parties and political groups, but also individual personalities and professionals who are harmonized in the same political vehicle. I saw that Maia Sandu, the president of PAS, Andrei Nastase, PPDA leader, Viorel Cibotaru, PLDM president, may again stand together and act jointly as they did in the presidential campaign.",
                "Continut": "<p>More joyful is not the rebirth of the right wing pro-European opposition unity, but I would say, the fact that the approach and the chosen topic are those that make the difference. It is no longer about small bites, toys or opinions, nor about options with less relevance, but rather about a fundamental topic for Moldova: the Transnistrian separatist conflict. Also extremely interesting is Oazu Nantoi's association, probably the deepest, the most knowledgeable and best known analyst on the subject of the Transnistrian separatism. Even more plastic, more cutting, the man you can not avoid on this domain.</p>\r\n<p>Returning to the combination of the pro-European right wing opposition with known personalities on a professional field, I find this step a substantial gain. Finnaly the opposition gathers together these personalities, it relates to them and their knowledge and they themselves endorse substantial topics and the political construct that would be able to carry out public policies in the field. A symbiotic combination that can be settled into a calling of bringing in the foreground and in the public policy space of some renowned professionals and some really important issues.</p>\r\n<p>The topic is welcomed and by the fact that it is launched on the eve of celebrating 25 years of the start of separatist conflict on Nistru River. And the primacy of the topic is relevant and well chosen, is strong and impactful - and this is validated by its subsequent takeover by third parties, representatives of other parties, both of the ruling parties and the opposition. It's also interesting to notice because it marks identities and positioning of the political actors in Moldova, creating and strengthening a pro-European assumed power, a leftist pro-Russian opposition, but with a President in office, and the pro-European opposition. Thusm it naturally emerges and the major differences between Maia Sandu's political clan and Dodon, PSRM, Zinaida Greceanii.</p>\r\n<p>It becomes important that the opposition leaves the small, frivolous topics or the exchange of minor words and to make the leap into a more concrete space of the subject and heavy, profound, deep agenda, with complicated topics, and the approach to be seriously weighed and to formulate a real and meaningful analysis, but also policies and alternatives. Transnistria, the separatism, and the fate of the free movement across the Dniester become of prime importance and it is announced as an expression of adequacy to the calendar and moment and it concerns a large number of citizens, taxpayers and voters in Moldova.</p>\r\n<p>The approach is welcomed and deserves to be noticed, even if we expect that Maia Sandu's political clan to acquire more substance, positions of reference and an ideational structuring that we are waiting for a long time. Perhaps the childhood of democracy on the Bic river ended and another pragmatic formula dominates the agenda, even if the ideological basis of the conglomerate of parties is still to be expected, as the draft and the vision of the pro-European right wing opposition leader, Maia Sandu, about the prospect of structuring and development of their political project with federal smack and several leaders. But the signal it's encouraging and we expect that the clear component of the scaffolding project of the opposition, with major relevance in the lives of everyday people, can be declared in the public space without distress and with the impact that it deserves, as well. Antagonizing Dodon's federalization projects and the utopian and unrealistic reactions and penalizing the absences of the actions of the power, the new political structure can become referentially, a competitor and a partner worthy of respect. But until the assuming positions and tough decisions in real time, Maia Sandu has a long way to go. She has to political maturity yet, she lacks experience but the Right Opposition leader also benefits from the opportunities of age. If she will know how to manage, to lead, to divide roles and to make the wide political group to act as one cohesive, Maia Sandu can continue to grow and affirm herself as a viable and perspective leader of Moldova.</p>",

                "lead": "The Prime Minister Pavel Filip met with the President's personal representative of the OSCE on combating anti-Semitism, Andrew Baker, who is on a working visit to Moldova. During the dialogue, Pavel Filip stated: \"Moldova is a multiethnic country, and the tolerance is our most valuable quality. And we need to educate further the society in this spirit. The representatives of the Hebrew community should feel good and safe in our country.\"",
                "Continut": "<p>Beyond the context of this declaration, the unique or circumstantial formulation of the Prime Minister Pavel Filip about the multiethnic status of Moldova keeps the attention. And this formulation, synonymous with the previous one made by Vladimir Voronin, who spoke about a multi-ethnic state, deserves a broader discussion and a relationship with the concepts in the field.</p>\r\n<p>Firstly, there is no the state that have experienced ethnic purity. Neither Hitler's Nazi Germany, after the Holocaust and the purges practiced by the Nazis, had not reached purity , and the Arianism is an excess not only abominable through effects, but impossible by parentage. Since the beginning of time people have been in contact and there are filiations and combinations of trans and inter-racial type, since the ancient times. To preach such a nonsense as purity or mono-ethnism is unanimously sanctioned globally and it is - attention - <em>a practical impossibility</em>. Between the predecessors on genetic line of each modern man is a combination of endless races, ethnicities, types, genes. So we can avoid the degeneration, knowing that the medieval excesses of conservation of royal blood lines led to degeneration and hemophilia and only fresh bastard blood could relaunch the hierarchical lines. The modern genetics has solved this problem long ago and placed it in perspective.</p>\r\n<p>That said, every nation, people, ethnicity (though this is where the political component intervene, not only objective affiliation and filiation elements belonging to a group) consists of a combination ethnicity. And every state has its way through its formation, native components and alien components, imported and developed within the national territory through immigration or other formulas.</p>\r\n<p>In most countries, after tracing the boundaries by Wilsonian version on disappearance of empires after World War I, the nations were creating on the basis of legitimacy of states; and the tracing of boundaries was done by leaving as much of the national territory, historically inhabited by a nation/ethnicity and as less as possible minorities in this territory. In every state remained a native nation, numerically dominant, and a suite of minorities, with increasingly wider rights. Reaching to the European Union model, with the third generation of minority rights, which guarantees full integration into the dominant nation and the full preservation of minority cultural identity, preservation of diversity and characteristic features.</p>\r\n<p>There are, indeed, and multiethnic states, multi-ethnic or multi-title nations. They have also another public reflection and structural formula, and that is how appeared federations and confederations. It is the case of Switzerland, where we have three titular nations, none majority, French, German and Italian. They coexist, work together, respect each other and are all natives. Besides numerous other local ethnic minorities.</p>\r\n<p>In the of the US, a new nation, composed mostly of immigrants who conquered the Old West, we talk about a civic nation, built in the last 200-odd years. A new nation. The natives, Native Americans - or native nation, as they are called - are searched and brought back to the foreground through special rights on the taxes - a formula of reverence and compensation, over time, for the lost lands in the clash of an ancestral civilization with Franco-British-Spanish colonists from the Middle Ages. Not incidentally the most casinos are owned by<em> Native Nation</em> representatives.</p>\r\n<p>More to the point,<em> to qualify Moldova as a multiethnic state or poly-ethnic is an aberration</em>. Moldova has an indigenous nation, with a majority of 60-70% and over, according to the census, made up of Romanians/Moldovans, depending on self-identification. They are legal masters in this land, along with native minorities of Ukrainians, Russians, Gagauz, Bulgarians (the last two - imports at the horizon of 1877 from the Ottoman Empire, allowed to pass by the Romanians and placed in Southern Bessarabia). Naturally, the minority rights are important, and Moldova respects these rights.</p>\r\n<p>Over there are those new immigrants. Firstly, the Soviet period migration, ongoing massive depopulation of Romanians in Bassarabia - especially the intellectuals, politicians, actors in administration, priests, teachers and rich peasants, medium and workers who all took the way to Siberia. Instead were brought representatives of Slavonic nations, especially, as well as other \"Soviet citizens\", especially in towns, to form the Soviet elite. After the fall of the USSR and The independence of the state, new immigrants have emerged and therefore in Moldova we have citizens of exotic origin states, who came later and settled here.</p>\r\n<p>The question - very good! - Why the Moldovan leaders do not affirm the existence and the rights of native ethnicity? Why, instead, they shake this topic about multi-poly-ethnicity, that does not do nothing, but to over-consecrate the Russians who came here and allows them, without being asked, undeserved privileges ?! Why exitsts this inferiority complex of an official as Pavel Filip - a Pure Blood Romanian/Moldovan, by name, not even with a Russified name - towards an artificially superposed \"blanket\" (section) of Russians that takes up 6, 7, maybe 9% of the population but dominate as well the public space today?</p>\r\n<p>Well, when there will be an answer and a fair presentation of this reality - the indigenous majority of Romanians/Moldovan towards Russian / Ukrainian, etc. minorities, the beneficiaries of all the rights along with all other minorities, but <em>without the privileges of the former settler</em> and dominant nation in the tsarist Empire/Bolshevik/Soviet/Russian - then there will not be a Dodon, President, who threatens to drag Moldova again in the steppes of Russia.</p>",

                "lead": "The relations between Moldova and the Russian Federation entered since Thursday in crisis, as a result of an act without precedent that expresses the exasperation of the Moldovan authorities, but also prospects for starting of a major repressive act (including in the form of military threats or subversive) of the Russian Federation. We are already talking about State matters with special relevance, to which the Moldovan authorities have had as a unique form of reaction the public exposure of the case and its posting in the official press release, of the responsibilities of the generals and the leadership of FSB (the former KGB) of Russian top politicians, called to act urgently.",
                "Continut": "<p>We talk about state a business. When the state authorities in a formula extended - the Speaker, the Prime Minister, the Ministers of Justice and Internal Affairs, the representative of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs - call an ambassador and give him a protest note of such gravity, a memo stating that the diplomats from the Republic Moldova, but also the case investigators of laundering of 22 billion dollars, are being harassed by the Russian authorities and that therefore no Moldovan official will not go to Moscow to solve the case; when all the action is made public in an expanded press release means, undoubtedly, that we face the most serious crisis that is passing Moldova after August 2009. The worst and also the most dangerous in relations with Russia since the Transnistrian War and the return from the airplane scale of Putin, who came in 2003 to sign the Kozak Memorandum.</p>\r\n<p>The case \"Laundromat\" means the laundering of 22 billion dollars through banks in Moldova. The mechanism is simple: a major Russian company has a commercial agreement on enormous amounts (of about 22 times the budget of Moldova, in total) with tiny, unknown companies in Chisinau. And because they have not paid, are obtained, at marginal courts around Chisinau, purchased court decisions, through which are enshrined some false debts. Major Russian companies immediately pay them to offshore or marginal companies, which in turn send further the money cleared by the customs. The mechanism is laundering the money of some Russian institutions or some people, generals or heads of the FSB, according to the official press release (which rejects, by the way, any political involvement).</p>\r\n<p><strong>The FSB reprisals against the authorities and the officials from Moldova</strong></p>\r\n<p>Well, as a result of orchestrating this case, as if by chance, appeared massive retaliation of FSB upon the Moldovan authorities. The communique does not directly quote the concerned service, but it talks that it would be the one in charge of guarding the borders and which would make the whole constellation of harassment complained. These actions, which have not stopped repeated after multiple warnings, determined a furious, solid and justified reaction of Moldovan authorities. Especially because more than 25 officials (including those involved in the investigation) were teased, humiliated, harassed, terrorized and rolled, contrary to all rules and any international commitments to which the Russian Federation is a party, the Moscow airports, although they had diplomatic passports and they were on business, possibly even in formal meetings!</p>\r\n<p>There were multiple actions through diplomatic channels, but no results. The politicians in the Russian Federation have completely ignored or felt that the service is doing its job with what it has in handy and it knows why is acting like this. In any case, as it seems - from their inactions - that they told themselves that, a war with the FSB is not worth for Moldova...</p>\r\n<p>But the cup was filled and I have witnessed the first action really serious the authorities in Chisinau, an action that shows and exasperation, and fear, and tension to the extreme of the bilateral relations, and the need to publicly expose and prevent further more important action, which probably they prepare.</p>\r\n<p><strong>It is, at the same time, and the first notable reaction of verticality and affirmation of the independence not of an official or another - we had a president who asked Putin the withdrawal of Russian troops, a Defense Minister who also demanded the withdrawal of two military attachés who were strolling around the Tiraspol - but of the Moldovan state in its entirety!</strong></p>\r\n<p>Thus, Thursday, March 9, exasperated by the inaction of Russian officials, the Speaker Andrian Candu, and the Prime Minister Pavel Filip have summoned the Russian Ambassador to Moldova Farit Muhametshin. At the meeting attended the Minister of Internal Affairs, Alexander Jizdan, the Minister of Justice, Vladimir Cebotari, and a representative of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and European Integration. The topic of the discussion was the transmission of an extremely harsh protest Memo to the political leadership of the Russian Federation, through which are reported a series of abuses committed against the officials of the Government, the special services and the ruling coalition parties in Moldova.</p>\r\n<p>The Moldovan officials are illegally stopped at the entrance to the Russian Federation, questioned, searched, treated outrageously by the representatives of the Russian special services. In the document also is described how abusive the FSB tried - several times in recent months - to pursue international several Moldovan politicians, including MPs, using for this purpose the false information and truncated data. The abundant calls were rejected for these reasons, and for reasons of a clear attempt to harass the officials from Chisinau.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Given in international pursuit with false papers: the investigators - 35 times in a row, the politicians - 15 times</strong></p>\r\n<p>There were situations where such requests have been transmitted 15 times just in case of a single person, which can not possibly induce the suspicion of political harassment. How the requests in question were rejected every time, the respective institutions of the Russian Federation passed to a new form of abuse that is trying to put the oficials under surveillance based on bilateral relations, by targeting specific states. And this time the Moldovan authorities managed to communicate with those countries and stopped the new abuse.</p>\r\n<p>In the sent note is signaled and the abuse on officers and prosecutors within the institutions that conduct the mentioned investigation, which is also subjects of abusive behavior at the entrance to the Russian Federation. Just in case there was an employee of the Interior Ministry, I said, no more than 35 abusive interventions, at the entrance or deaparture from an airport in Moscow.</p>\r\n<p>The Russian Ambassador, Farid Muhametshin was announced that until the problem is resolved, the Moldovan officials will not go to Moscow. All these abuses have escalated once the investigators in Chisinau advanced in the investigations on Laundering of 22 billion dollars through Moldinconbank coming from Russian Federation. Specifically, immediately after were arrested officials of the bank above mentioned, and judges and executors were put under accusation, some of them already sent to court.</p>\r\n<p>In addition, the retaliations widened after there were requests for rogatory letters to the Russian Federation. The abuses have intensified with the requests submitted by the Moldovan investigators, in the Russian Federation, to obtain information on the provenance of the mentioned money, essential for testing the entire criminal path in this case. We note that the investigation revealed as well links between some of the money and an attempt to bribe some MPs of the Parliament of Moldova.</p>\r\n<p>Also mention the total lack of cooperation of law enforcement bodies of the Russian Federation with the Moldovan investigators in this case, as well the refusal to respond to rogatory commissions transmitted by the Moldovan prosecutors in the investigation of the laundering of the 22 billion dollars. In this respect, have been violated several bilateral agreements but also international agreements to which the Russian Federation is a party.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Casus beli with serious consequences in Chisinau</strong></p>\r\n<p>Any analysis of these facts show that we are dealing with a serious case with serious risks concerning the use of some more serious tools of military intervention type or subversion: the undermining of the Moldovan state, compromising and intoxication, misinformation and active measures. Only this perspective explains why the case went public in these terms: once exposed, the ability to intervene, of cavil and subversive actions is more difficult to cover and manage, thus to denounce assumptions.</p>\r\n<p>Also, this type of approach - that separates the responsibility of FSB and the Russian politicians - might prove a charade or a good option. Basically, Chisinau left Russia an exit, a path of withdrawal, once considered that the culprits are just the leadership and the generals of the almighty domestic intelligence service of Russia (although - the practice dixit - reflects the whole post-Soviet space and not infrequently beyond). As analysts, however, we can not consider that businesses and money laundering with such amounts - 22 billion dollars - could be done in the Russian Federation without Putin's knowledge. Here the truth will come out soon, depending on the reaction to the already addressed public summons.</p>\r\n<p>On the other hand, the anger of Moscow is, probably, great, if the type of reaction is described in the official press release: ignoring the diplomatic passport, the agreement between states, the harassment of those concerned, giving an APB on false documents, the involvement of institutions such as Interpol, Europol, and then of other third countries in this process, finally, harassing and attempts to bury a case of this magnitude. The legend says that after the annexation of Crimea, were seized/frozen the funds of a Russian bank which have close to 48 billion dollars - a presumptive part of Vladimir Putin's personal wealth. Here it would be about half that amount, comparable, however, with 20 times of the budget of Moldova.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Who fights with the Russian corruption, the<strong> global<strong> and the</strong></strong> true one</strong></p>\r\n<p>The state with the highest corruption in the European region (minus the Russian Federation), the Republic of Moldova seems to have started combating the corruption in the hardest and more serious cases. And it's not about the famous and much-publicized unique oligarch, Vladimir Plahotniuc, who would have captured the state. Not even about the president without occupation of Moldova, Igor Dodon, who said that he has income and he made his campaign with funds borrowed from his parents. No. It's about really heavy cases of justice that could not move without a solid international cooperation and involving serious institutions in the world, and many countries able to pursue these amounts of money further.</p>\r\n<p>A first sign of recovery and determination to combat corruption had been given by the case of the disappeared billion from three banks through fictitious loans actions and extracting the stored money by the owner himself, through deceitful maneuvers. Already in this case was arrested and sentenced Vlad Filat, the former Prime Minister, who was the only culprit for a long time, hence the charges based on selective justice, if not political vengeance in this form. There was also Ilan Shor, but here was the issue of the lack of a real preventive measures on him, although he was the lead author of theft. With Shor and Filat has joined, however, Veaceslav Platon, extradited from Kiev. But here has been speculated about the Plahotniuc-Poroshenko relationship and the revenge on \"the poor\" businessman Platon. This \"poor\" is actually the architect of the \"Laundromat\" scheme in Moldova and the owner of the bank \"Moldincombank\", the bank through which would have been laundered the billions of the Russians. Well, last week's heavyweight list was filled with Talmaci, the former governor of the National Bank, later the chairman of the Administration Council at Platon's bank, \"Moldincombank\". So already the panoply to fight corruption is greatly enriched, even though \"the most hated person\" in Chisinau, Vlad Plahotniuc was not never touched, on the contrary, he seemed to be behind the decision on reforms, fighting corruption and still hovered in the air the flavor of unilateralism and of the direction of his actions directed only to third parties.</p>\r\n<p>More seriously is the fact that few have realized the relevance and weight of the moment in this equation. Thatit was not Igor Dodon who di this - whose only concern is to say that he travels further to Moscow even next week - no wonder. He who is a hell of a head of state, is trying to hide under the carpet an extremely serious case from the position of representative of Russian interests, not of the defender of the Republic of Moldova!</p>\r\n<p><strong>More serious is the fact that neither the opposition, very little routinely used in developments from Moldova and its surroundings and too much jammed in small politicking games, with the bad oligarch and the state captive, they failed to understand the relevance of the moment for the Moldovan state, regardless of who ensures the governing. Unfortunately, neither the civil society did not notice the moment, to support this great endeavor, firmly placed under the sign of the national interest, beyond political disputes.</strong></p>",

                "lead": "Dodon's arrival at the Presidency happened after a campaign and an election manifestation preceded by political outputs to the streets to challenge the situation in Moldova, the corruption and the theft of the billion. Dodon played the vigilante role, who comes and knights all those who steal the money of the people and needy citizens. Therefore the young, the poor do not get to have what they need, says the socialist doctrine, because the money is stolen by the corrupted. Naturally the first in question is the bad oligarch, Mr. P., who captured the state and does what he wants in Moldova, being guilty of all evils.",
                "Continut": "<p>The recent visit to Moscow (the second official after two unofficial ones) has betrayed not only the inappropriate political positioning, the undermining of the state power and the position of the Republic of Moldova, by breaking an established boycott - without consulting him, it's true, but by the authorities that represent the sovereignty in the state, not the discretionary power that he wants to arrogate - but to an extremely serious issue, that of violation of the rules against Moldovan diplomats in Moscow. To his political indictment it is added, without appeal, and the assumption by the President of the posture of a tool in the information war of Russia with their own state, and even something worse, more destructive for his political posture and his image of a vigilante.</p>\r\n<p>Dodon's main problem is not his orientation, but his subordination to his policies towards Russian interests. Sometimes so ostentatious that he becomes laughable and caricatural, and he stirs embarrassment to the Russian government and Vladimir Putin himself. His constant frown, the verb that he wants to be strong and serious, tough and persuasive, does nothing but only to undermine the message and to create side effects to the image of defender and exclusive promoter of Russian interests. But where things start to get really serious is that where the vigilante President starts to cause the undermining process to fight corruption, as it happened in Moldova, where it starts to gain momentum.</p>\r\n<p>First he shocked his position on combating corruption of huge proportions, globally, the laudering of 52 billion in a process that involves Russian oil companies and post-Soviet states, of which $ 22 billion were carried through Moldova. The vigilante was supposed to be the first to support the work of institutions to combat corruption, law enforcement and justice. But he entirely ignored the subject, took refuge in the battle to support a pro-Russian position by continuing the representation in the Russian Federation.</p>\r\n<p>A warlike stance against corruption at any level would have also coincided with the role of vigilante, and that of agent of the Russian policy on which he has undertaken. Eventually, there were concerned money of Russian oil companies. If we had to fight with a special operation, managed by the FSB, as indicated by the Moldovan authorities, it would be a direct action to undermine the Russian economy, and the discussion on the topic would only inquire the Russian authorities and Vladimir Putin, who would shown gratitude for the information and action, and would have reacted harshly. The reaction of Moscow and of Igor Dodon betrayed, however, the fact that based on laundering the money that strips the Russian taxpayer, the population of the Russian Federation, was a special operation approved by the Russian authorities, consented by them.</p>\r\n<p>The type of behavior summarized to breaking the representation of the Republic of Moldova to Moscow blockade indicates that the subject was known, but not assumed. The public exposure of laundering money in this highly complex way in Chisinau, a business that involves so many corrupt people, including the area of supervision of the National Bank, is also painful for the Russian leadership, it costs external image and impact of the absolute force and the omnipotence of Putin's regime. Instead the absence of reaction indicates that the exposure of the scandal failed to provoke reactions and visibility in the Russian Federation - about as many as the acts of corruption and embezzlement of Medvedev, exposed by Navalnii. For the President in Chisinau, however, the impact is even more devastating because it undermines the very foundation of his project and the mechanism of attracting votes.</p>\r\n<p>In Moldova, the total absence of Igor Dodon from this mega deal, to the resolution of which attended many institutions and states that have cooperated with domestic institutions in Chisinau, does nothing but to emphasize that this is not, in fact, a vigilante. He does not care to fight corruption and the theft of the billion, but simply the power struggle and rivalry with Vladimir Plahotniuc. More seriously, by recognizing the limits of his capacity to respond publicly in a major case that involves Russia, undermining the fight against corruption still raises even more serious questions, and eats the constantly pedestal of vigilante with which Dodon won the election. Thus, we saw worries, concerns and mayors from Basarabeasca and what happens with him. It is unacceptable for a President!</p>\r\n<p>Undermining the fight against corruption, failing to recognize it when it is actually happening with the participation of Moldovan state institutions, and even unwarrantable interference with justice causes, in fact, Igor Dodon's abdication from his electoral program and the political program of the Socialist Party. There is only his option to drag Moldova in deep Siberia, in the direct subordination to Russia, in a new Russian Empire, and nothing else. </p>\r\n<p>It should be recalled, if there were any doubt, that Igor Dodon won the presidency not to fight, undermine and stop Moldova's pro-European path and its strategic misappropriating orientation. But for the promised support of social measures for the population, to fight corruption, to satisfy people who are living poorly and they need to tighten their belts once more to pull Moldova out of crisis. Now, after he has not justified his own revenue and campaign financing, he joins in a process of undermining the fight against high-level corruption and the judicial independence, with unqualified interference in the judicial act.</p>\r\n<p>After his election as president, we witnessed the abandonment of the electoral agenda from the front row - that of president of Moldova he abandoned a long time ago and he never again was the President of all citizens of Moldova. He deals with flags, the Romanian language and Romanian history; not fighting corruption, the judicial independence and conviction of culprits that strips the state revenues and of the citizens. He became a suicidal president.</p>",

                "lead": "Espionage, one of the oldest occupations in the world, is the prerogative of professionals. What do you do when it combines with treason, with financial interests and even political projects to support the interests of a foreign state by a politician or public official who has access to sensitive information that would otherwise have to use to benefit their own state?",
                "Continut": "<p>The Post-Soviet space is a favorite region of action of the Russian secret service. To the point where the internal information service of the Russian FSB, successor of the more famous KGB, is in charge of the entire post-Soviet space, and not the Russian foreign intelligence, the SVR. To them are added GRU, the Russian military intelligence service, extremely aggressive and present lately on all meridians. All these services have an important operational component, which means that they conduct important aggressive operations in targeted areas.</p>\r\n<p>As the new independent states were not born either with their own armed forces or intelligence services, the Russian secret services roam peaceful all this space. Moreover, when these instruments of State began to be formed and operate, there were still based military and intelligence officers who came from the former Soviet structures and had colleagues, friends, comrades, superiors in Russian services. Hence the total domination of these national services of the new States of the FSB and GRU, more, sometimes even the appointment of heads of national services was made from or with the approval of Moscow (see the SBU case during Yanukovych's time).</p>\r\n<p>The major element of the rift was the colored revolutions or wars of national liberation. If Georgia has developed capabilities of intelligence major after taking over the power in Tbilisi by Mihail Saakashvili after the Rose Revolution of 2003, in Ukraine things got more difficult and with several ups and downs, starting with the Kravchuk nationalist's administration who launched the idea of standalone and started to build up the Kuchma administration, who wanted an Intensified dialogue with NATO and to remake the security sector reform with the Alliance, with more or fewer achievements, and continuing with Viktor Yushcenko and the orange Revolution. The succession of regimes roundtrip has not helped to a structure for completely independent information in Kiev, this being born, slowly, after the annexation of Crimea and military aggression in eastern Ukraine and after the security system reform initiated then. So it's difficult.</p>\r\n<p>A similar story has had and has the SIS of Moldova. The creation of the MSN in origin was far from being a detachment of Russian structures, but rather a post-Soviet continuity. Since the establishment of SIS, the independence or the dependence of the intelligence service from its Russian counterparts have followed the trends of independence or dependence of Moldova to Russia at the political level. The steps were difficult and there were ups and downs. What we can say is that the nationalist independence (Moldovan, it's true) Vladimir Voronin was one of those who really supported such a separation, after 2003, but things were not linear under his leadership. After 2009, there were more substantial steps performed by the security sector reform and twinning programs, but here the steps were rather modest and shy.</p>\r\n<p>Today we can look carefully and relatively confident the institution, along with its removal from the subordination of the pro-Russian president who was to come, Igor Dodon, and its placement under the Government and Parliament. But neither here the enhancing guidance does not seem complete. A few things are worth mentioning, starting with radicalization of Islam and expulsions, to arrest of foreign fighters from the theater in Eastern Ukraine, up to prevent some separatist movements and intercepting special documents by going to the Russian soldiers that crossed the Chisinau Airport, en route to Tiraspol, in all these cases have been taken important steps by the SIS.</p>\r\n<p>However major points of support the optimism of independent development of of an information service come from the contribution to service the famous deal of money laundering of 22 billion dollars through banks in Moldova - not prevention, but support for knowledge and further testing those involved . Lately, we had the case of a spy traitors registered.</p>\r\n<p>On 17 March, the prosecutors of the Prosecutor's Office for Combating Organized Crime and Special Causes jointly with the officers of security and intelligence arrested in the act a citizen of Moldova, who held public positions for a long time, including the deputy in the Moldovan Parliament, Iurie Bolboceanu. The arrest in flagrant happened when transmitting information of national interest to Alexandr Grudin, the aid to Russian military attaché.</p>\r\n<p>The investigation conducted over seven months proved recruitment, training and deployment of crimes under Art. 337 and Art. 338 of the Criminal Code of Moldova - \"High Treason\" and \"Espionage\" as well as the entire <em>modus operandi</em>. We will not go into details here. The fact is that the arrest measure and public exposure, with all possible data and evidence, proved on the one hand the decision of the responsible institutions to intervene and the ability to do it professionally, with all available evidence. And here is worth paying attention and interpretation the gesture to conduct and exposure of such a case.</p>\r\n<p>The fact that Russia spies in Moldova is a common thing. It romps in this space with all the tools in sight. From blind exploitation to placing its representatives in decision-making positions. The fact that today we have an exposed case indicates that limits have been exceeded long ago and that there are Chisinau's firm decision to fight back. Bolboceanu is only a tool, a functional element in the huge machine of Russian services in Chisinau. Some are in public positions, others in high dignity of the state up to the highest level. Here we are dealing with formulas of information delivery versus money in a form of conspiracy, professional. But at the level of espionage made by politicians and decision makers, others received cash bricks almost in sight, in public places, directly from diplomatic representatives. \"To what do I owe this pleasure today?\" greet such a high and titrated politician the official from the Russian embassy who delivered him the package with money, according to citizens who unwittingly assisted to this process.</p>\r\n<p>Then, another time, this game was not sanctioned. The payment with envelopes and bricks of money (dollars, euros, but never rubles or MDL) is a one current and in sight, and no one does not notify of the enormity of payment by foreign citizens of some political leaders with major powers in state institutions. Should we be surprised then by the security level of the Republic of Moldova and the penetration of institutions by services of third countries? Especially Russia?</p>\r\n<p>Moldova is not the only target. There, a few days ago the Security Service of Ukraine detained nine people, who are said to be members of the network information of the Russian military intelligence service, GRU, according to the head of the director of Security Service of Ukraine, Alexander Tkachuk, a network consisting of former and current soldiers. Their goal was to penetrate the strategically important targets in the southern regions of Ukraine for collecting information and carrying out sabotage and terrorist attacks. GRU agents network coordinator was a woman from Odessa, public servant, trained in the GRU information center in Crimea. Four GRU agents are arrested. The rest are \"under the control\" of SBU.</p>\r\n<p>Also in the US an investigation aims, this time, the component of agents of influence around the future President Trump and from his administration area. All to establish clearly which actions are legitimate and which ones are falling under the paid services by the Russian services.</p>\r\n<p>The SIS action the other day constitutes a very serious warning of credible discouraging, released by SIS and Moldovan authorities. It was a case, it may be others, up to the highest level. Anyone in politics who is dealing with espionage for money and treason, on the grounds that Moldova must be dragged into the depths of Siberia, into a new future of the Russian Empire, should know that Moldova is serious state and that spies and traitors will pay. Up to the highest level. Notice to the amateurs! And all those who have to search in theit consciousness the moments when they gave information and received money, possibly in places where they were already filmed and where there are witnesses who are exposed and deserve to lose their functions and clogging jails. Regardless of where in the hierarchy of decision and mandate that they have.</p>",

                "lead": "At 60 years since signing the Treaty of establishing the European Communities, the meeting in Rome marked, both, an anniversary moment and a deeply pragmatic one. Eventually, the European Commission and the Heads of State and Government needed to send a message of unity before the formal announcement of accessing the Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty by Britain and the initiation of negotiations for leaving the EU. Because on 29 March, Prime Minister Theresa May will formally announce the Brexit.",
                "Continut": "<p>There were two major issues of the Rome Declaration: the formal consecration of Europe with two or more gears, of Europe with variable geometry or the one of concentric circles - in fact, breaking Europe and moving the decision to the Europe's strict hard core, although the decision concerns and affects all Member States. Then the European defense and security issue, that will not contradict NATO, will not duplicate efforts and will not push beyond common defense system of US, Canada and UK.</p>\r\n<p>Alternatively, the agreement also had two necessary points: first, to save Jean Claude Juncker's approach and to maintain the five options strictly within the space of those proposed. Secondly, not to destroy the favored option of the founding states for the third solution (Europe with two or more gears), respectively, to maintain the possibility of associating for further integration, more profound, of those who want this.</p>\r\n<p>The act of Rome opened important paths and for the Associated States and for the applicant ones: If the integration perspective creates problems both to the aspirants and to the Member States, and creates, at the same time, nervousness in Moscow, the addressed option is more flexible and with strong opportunities for European integration. So, anyone who wants, can rally in European projects, step by step or faster, depending on their own political will, reforms and desire.</p>\r\n<p>It's also the case of Republic of Moldova: it can enter in the core of the European projects, if it wishes, even without becoming a member, by having a more integrated posture more skeptical, reluctant or less anxious than that of a Member State. Thus, it can anchor itself directly to the European project and participate in projects as long as it proves reforms and the will of the people of deeper integration. But it is Moldova's job to pull Bruxeles, to show what it did and to wish for the integration, not Brussels to drag Moldova, to do the necessary reforms. And Romania will always be there to help in this direction.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Playing at high risk: From the split of Europe to the explosion of the European project</strong></p>\r\n<p>The European leaders have chosen the best and unique option for today. Even if it means a high risk game. First of all, it relied on a constructive ambiguity of formulations, on solutions that will give a signal of unity and will reverse the trend of negative emotions and reversal of European unity. Such an approach has a chance of stemming the centrifugal tendencies, especially as the states begin to see the treatment to which is subjected UK and the EU abandonment costs, so the constraint plays a major role.</p>\r\n<p>Then, the coherence is ensured by the presumed will of the founding states to move forward and to continue the integration of a federal Europe. More quickly, without jamming, by giving up the national attributes, to a formula developed in the United States of Europe. It is true that here remains the over-optimistic assessment that Western societies - the first that addressed the skepticism and the fatigue, the populism and the blocking of European integration - would go forward with popular majority support and without the side effects to give birth to a negative reaction of rejection of such a trend.</p>\r\n<p>The present approach marks a major shift in the approach, but also introduces a much higher level of accepted risk. Going on a federal Europe is an act of courage, of European spirit pushed to maximum, it drives away the risk of a two-geared Europe (or more), the risk of an Iron Curtain relocated in Eastern Europe, as characterized by the President Klaus Johannis . But it relaunches the possibility of even greater risk: the explosion of the European project, if this path does not work or if the populism prevails in Europe. And the presidential elections and subsequently the general ones in France are characteristic for the chance of this project.</p>\r\n<p>Personally, I would have opted for a more moderate and realistic option, that involves lower risks and better chances for a united and whole Europe: integration, but at the rate that it would not lose the present gains nor the existing members of the project. But it was not in the five options of Juncker, it did neither satisfy the desire of the founding states of exceptionalism, to be able to choose to move forward on their own, even if they are not followed by their own citizens.</p>\r\n<p>The current version brings major advantages and for the Associated States: of the Western Balkans that have the commitment of the Thessaloniki on the European integration perspective, and of those from the Eastern Partnership. Because the integration perspective can provoke multiple reactions and it may take time, it may be too sudden and to costly internally, the offered option of elections by the book, of embraced projects allow that, after access to the free trade and free movement, the following steps should be elected by the person concerned.</p>\r\n<p>The effects of changes are multiple: for the Member States, it means mobilizing their own political class to produce reforms and changes in their own country, to be as close as possible to the developments of the European core and to matter as much as possible. For candidate countries or associated ones, the option is still the one of reforms and of EU approximation through their own efforts, and then pointing out that you can embrace slices of the acquis and the European project closer to the membership charter and to new integrationist projects of perspective.</p>\r\n<p>It's an opportunity, but already the asymmetry of the relationship moves from the EU, which dragged the Member States, the candidate countries associated to these states themselves, that have to prove reforms, the will and the desire of joining to federal Europe as expensive as such project would be for national sovereignties. All because no state will survive, in the future, by its own the globalization, and the integration is the only chance.</p>\r\n<p><strong>The \"multi-geared\" Europe reached \"different rhythms and intensities\" of integration.</strong></p>\r\n<p><em>\"The greatest danger that it would bring assumption of a concept of Europe with multiple gears in the EU declaration of Rome would be the return to the geometry of the Iron Curtain\"</em>, said the President Klaus Iohannis in a press conference at the end of 60-year anniversary summit since the signing of EU treaties. <strong><em>\"If we would accept two-geared Europe, sooner or later, the second gear was in the East. Then it would come back the fears deep of the Easterners: to be left behind. I made several arguments and there were arguments in support of my exposure and I managed eventually to find expressions better,\"</em></strong> concluded the President.</p>\r\n<p>In the<em> Joint Declaration of Rome</em> is kept the mitigating tone on multi-geared Europe, with reference to a Europe with different rhythms and intensities, which respects the right of all to join the enhanced cooperation and assumes that all Member States shall go together in the same direction.</p>\r\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong><em>\"The Unity is both a necessity, and also our free choice. At individual level we would be marginalized by global dynamics. Together we have the most likely chances to influence it and to defend our common interests and values. We will work together with different rhythms and intensities where it is necessary, but going in the same direction as we did in the past, in accordance with the Treaties and keeping the door opened to those who wish to join later.Our Union is undivided and indivisible\"</em></strong> reads the text of the statement.<strong><em> \"Any enhanced cooperation between several Member States must comply with the EU Treaties and to be opened on the basis of objective criteria to all Member States\",</em></strong> also transmited President Klaus Iohannis in the text of Romania's contribution to the joint statement at Rome.</p>\r\n<p>The substantial difference is that any new step more powerful must go through treaties, ie to have the agreement of all existing members. So the specific difference is that the decision is left to all Member States. The decision will not be taken by some, while others suffer the consequences. A major point of negotiation, gained by the new members and small states.</p>\r\n<p>The main message remains, undoubtedly, the unit of Europeans in the context of the unprecedented challenges and in the wider context of a debate more heated on the future of Europe: a union with multiple gears and a union that prepares to negotiate the exit of Great Britain from its institutional architecture. The European Union is defined as <em>\"a community of peace, freedom, democracy, human rights and the rule of law, a parallel economic power with levels of social protection and welfare.\"</em> However, the main commitment that leaders took aims to create a stronger European Union through a stronger solidarity and unity.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Security and Defense: Cooperation and complementarity with NATO</strong></p>\r\n<p>And on this dimension, the compromise could be identified. Under the title A stronger Europe on the global stage, the text provides a union that develops further existing partnerships, builds new ones and promote stability and prosperity in its eastern and southern neighborhood, but also the Middle East, across Africa and globally . Then the Western countries and military equipment companies find their desire to support at European level by providing a Union ready to take on more responsibilities and help create a more competitive and integrated defense industry.</p>\r\n<p>On the other hand, the Western countries, France in particular, have yielded fully to the existing reality and the transatlantic partnership, accepting a union determined to strengthen the security and defense policy, in cooperation and in complementarity with NATO, by taking into account national circumstances and legal commitments. Basically, the theme of European army disappeared in the known formula, and the partnership with NATO or the preeminence of NATO common defense affairs was re-established in the spirit of the Joint Declaration of the Warsaw Summit.</p>\r\n<p>Finally, the EU it is stated as a Europe of liberal-democratic values, of an open society and inclusive societies. A Europe of whose values are defined in direct opposition to the populism, xenophobia, Islamophobia, anti-Semitism, discrimination, exceptions, inequalities and privileged access of some resources.</p>\r\n<p>Through this position, the EU it is stated as a absolute rival of totalitarian and oppressive systems such as in Russia, and at variance with the current approaches of the US President, Donald Trump, even if common values and principles are maintained and the transatlantic relationship emerges refreshed after the Declaration of Rome, which threaten this size. Institutionally, the EU is close to America and to this day, but not with the inappropriate populist/isolationist and discriminatory starts that promotes the current US president, to which the approach seems to be that the American political and democratic system must react to bring to respect the values of the Declaration of Independence and the US Constitution. And this is an outcome of the democracy.</p>",

                "Continut": "<p><strong>One of the founding myths, even constitutive of the political and public scene in today's Moldova is the omnipotence of Vlad Plahotniuc, called in diplomatic circles in Chisinau - as well as in the capitals concerned about developments in the area - in an almost subversive way, Mr. P. The myth of limitless and full power of Mr. P. was achieved by a combination of patterns and themes of communication, based on the captive state theory, through The Evil oligarch and continuing afterwards with the creation of the guilty in service myth. <em>It doesn't matter what, why and who makes something happen to in Moldova, it's Mr. P.'s fault</em>. Because, in a completely absurd way, although in a deep democratic logic, if you hold the absolute power, as it's presumed to Plahotniuc, then you have and absolute responsibility, you are responsible for everything that anyone is doing anytime.</strong></p>\r\n<p>Truth be told, to this myth of the omnipotence of Vlad Plahotniuc - The Supreme oligarch who took Moldova into captivity and flays it of resources - has contributed to a large extent, himself. Actively, cultivating the picture of an entirely responsible man and encouraging stories and pictures of himself as a powerful one and an ultimate decision maker, whether it's about crime organized, mafia or government, or business, privatization or media (even if it's not true ). Or passive, avoiding to denounce gossips and stories to this direction. Mr. P, through its media, through hard and sudden blows given to political rivals, business or those in the criminal sphere, being a testimony, has cultivated the very own image that will lead him to doom, hence the image of the most hated man in Moldova (I refer to those present in the public space and sociologically measured) and guilty of all evils.</p>\r\n<p>The fact that it is not true is a truism. Who knows the social and societal structure, the degree of institutionalization of society in Moldova and administrative functionality of existing institutions, knows at the same time very well that there are many things that Mr. P. is missing. Moreover, no one can include such a complexity and size, even in countries with a better organized and greater administrative capacity. Over all, even the big trends, and business processes are not even fully known, let alone controlled by Vladimir Plahotniuc, until is happening.</p>\r\n<p>As for the his omnipotence proverbial, it has not been for the earlier period, when there was the second responsible, Vlad Filat, but he was not there and did not manifested himself even after this time, when both political space and public space was dominated by multiple political tendencies, orientations and different perceptions. That's because <em>Moldova really is a democracy in terms of real pluralism and that money can not buy everything and everyone, regardless how many years</em>.</p>\r\n<p>The clearest evidence is that in the state that Mr.P. is claiming (and claims also himself to a point) that he possesses, he never managed more than 20% to the polls with his party (Vlad Filat, with more political sense and infinitely more charisma, has managed much better, every time). Then, in the same state that he possesses, Vladimir Plahotniuc could not be prime minister. And, also in the same state, in which he dominates the politics, the public space, the financial resources, Mr. P. could not ever make the ordinary citizens to love, to appreciate, to support him, to trust him. No more than 2,5-3-5% according to recent polls.</p>\r\n<p>But the part of the analysis that we do, so far, had relevance in the presidential election and may have relevance in the next general election, this myth slipped slightly to a false perception and even more dangerous one: better with Dodon, with the Socialists, with the Russians, in the Euro-Asian Union, than Plahotniuc to have any modicum of power any longer! Another obvious false: Mr. P. does not have the absolute power, he holds some symbolic power and confidence, plus a more limited financial strength, either. As for the political power, it is almost irrelevant in the face of politicians made or born in the internal political battle in Moldova. Then, to choose between the Devil and and his Dad - the Supreme Scaraotski, just to never see his devil's face, I find it like a barbaric policy.</p>\r\n<p>I explain myself: in order to have democracy, rule of law, security, prosperity, development, it must be, first of all, rules, but also European and Euro-Atlantic orientation. The Russians ask to worship the only Daddy, no need of reforms or go to jail, if you stole. If you pay them their part, they forget you immediately. The bribery, the undeserved and illegal goods and benefits are the ultimate exchange currency to maintain power; the tribute and the gift, instruments of acceptance of the tribute. So it's easy and does not cost you freedom, prestige, your political future and shame of the family. Only the European road requires rules, limits, constraints, real competition, equality of access to opportunities, independence of the judiciary, fighting corruption, democracy, rule of law, good governance.</p>\r\n<p>Worse, the strategic reorientation not only lead to loss of democratic perspective, economic, of prosperity, of development, rule of law, but even the disappearance of the entire state. Placing Moldova in the subordination and at the mercy of the new Russian Empire, means the complete disappearance of the state. It's not about sovereignty and independence, but Russia's interests of limited sovereignty. Where is the patriotism, the strength to defend the independence, sovereignty and territorial integrity?<em>When you fight a political choice, unionism, and an ethnic community, the Romanians, the majority in Moldova, and ignore the territory occupied by the army of a foreign country, Russia, you look the other way when the same state recruit your people into its army, when it defies your officials and state insignia your on the official passports, when you pretend to fight corruption but do not say another word about illegal laundering of 22 billion dollars by the FSB of the same Russians through your own state, all this shows that the world is crooked and that the protagonist does not have anything to do with any element of national interest, but rather the sale of the country.</em></p>\r\n<p>But again, another myth is built in the public space and in the chanceries: the myth of understanding between Plahotniuc and Dodon, with the corollary of Dodon's control by Plahotniuc. Or here we are dealing with an utopia, the politician hearty dominates the businessman, and the total lack of response to violation of the Constitution and the guidelines laid down by the constitutional mechanisms of state creates confusion and strengthens the theory of underground understanding.</p>\r\n<p>Well I expected that, after visits to Moscow and Bruxeles, of the statements made internally and actions with Krasnoselskii, the majority would react with major sanctions, the Government would have trenchant positions, both institutions would go to the Constitutional Court to sanction the poltroon and bring him within the limit of his powers; not to let him wander alone on the plains. It was not so, and here if to maintain this shyness or absence of will and action, with two whimpers through press statements and three words through some press release, it might fundamentally affect the actions of the Government through unconstitutional and unenforceable interference of the enthroned president.</p>\r\n<p>So, I do not believe in the understanding between the two, although I think Dodon was assisted by Mr. P. in the presidential campaign, rather Maia Sandu. I can believe that he prefers the known evil, but not because he does not realize that the politician will take his head with the first opportunity. And above all, that a response is required, otherwise the trend is suicidal and the relinquish of power to the Socialists, the pro-Russians and Moscow is close. For at least another half century. Notice and to the right wing opposition from the street, myopic in weighting their enemies and priorities!</p>",

                "lead": "At the end of last week, there was a shocking news about an arrest of a criminal gang who were supposed to perform the paid assassination of Vladimir Plahotniuc, the Evil oligarch, who captured the Moldovan state, as he is known - in different media channels - that mostly belong to the political class and became the perception of the majority in the Republic of Moldova. The hate is so great that no one hesitated to think about the substance and the enormity of the news, but started to make fun, mocking the news and covering it in a conspiracy theory of an arrangement to increase in polls or insulting the potential victim, showing sorrow that the attempt from April 7 failed and even saying that would have done it for free.",
                "Continut": "<p>We do not comment here the degree of humanity and the faith of the Moldovan population in the Easter Fast, on the eve of Palm Sunday. In moments of forgiving our debtors, it is clear that Vladimir Plahotniuc has many enemies, he is feared and hated in abundance, mostly deserved, perhaps, but drawing the individual choice and the party one just by humor and emotion seems detached from the Middle Ages, the era when rationality, humanism, Enlightenment was not known. Even worse to assume to write an editorial on this subject.</p>\r\n<p>Faithful to the promise to comment with relevant cold, including the bill of criminal elements, I took the risk of being associated with the subject and decided to look at this dossier. With convenient public information at the time of writing the editorial, and of course being interested in the relevant elements at the strategic level for Moldova.</p>\r\n<p>Thus, what we know from the authorities is that an Ukrainian citizen known criminal leader, had received the order to execute the assassination of Mr. P. 17 persons were detained with the cooperation of Ukrainian and Moldovan intelligence: 8 in Moldova and 9 in Ukraine, obviously before executing the act. The murder cost was 200 000 dollars and the first installment had been paid, i.e. 100 000 dollars.</p>\r\n<p>The attack was to take place at the building of Global Business Center, where Plahotniuc has the office, with the use of firearms, including grenade launchers with cumulative effect, targeting the building and the car of the victim. Further searches led to the detection of money, radios, weapons and objects for cloaking, including two pistols with silencers and four grenades. All the involved persons and those who ordered the assasinationare going to be identified. Now, there are several suspects, including a Moldovan citizen residing in the Russian Federation, and some are in Moldova, which are linked and have mutual interest.</p>\r\n<p>Some things are worth noting in this operation of Ukrainian and Moldovan police: cooperation, leisurely proving all the facts with video evidence, spying, wiretaps, complete capture of the criminal group, identifying the clients. After evaluating the evidence presented to us it is clear that the Ukrainian and Moldovan services had infiltrated people in the group and could identify and thwart the full plan.</p>\r\n<p>The most interesting thing - and most discussed - from the whole affair is the combination of criminal area, the reference to the client, the Moldovan citizen residing in the Russian Federation (unspecified) and hints to the Russian secret services. Even clear reference elements: „relationships, contacts of the heads of the criminal group (Ukraine) show that the fulfillment of the assassination was attended by representatives of the Russian special services”. Moreover, „those who were to implement the plans were about to return to Ukraine to discredit the Ukrainian authorities and worsen the relations between Moldova and its neighbor”.</p>\r\n<p><a class=\"smallbox\" style=\"display: inline !important;\" href=\"http://dpsu.gov.ua/ua/news/za-likvidaciyu-lidera-demokratichnoi-partii-rm-volodimira-plahotnyuka-zlovmisnikam-obicyali-200-tisyach-dolariv-ssha/\">http://dpsu.gov.ua/ua/news/za-likvidaciyu-lidera-demokratichnoi-partii-rm-volodimira-plahotnyuka-zlovmisnikam-obicyali-200-tisyach-dolariv-ssha/<span style=\"color: #000000; font-family: Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 12px;\">.</span></a></p>\r\n<p>However, in Moldova the concerned ones entered the country bypassing the border crossings between Ukraine and Moldova, so with full premeditation of everyone involved. However, <strong>this combination is interesting between criminal-mafia world, political revenge and terrorist state murder, conducted by the Russian secret services.</strong> It is known, especially since recently Moscow has reactivated political assassination and uses it widely, at the basis of the actions are GRU, military intelligence service, who acted also in Montenegro (missed) and Serbia (missed and still questionable), and in Kiev, a few times, and so on.</p>\r\n<p>So, the big question is whether we are dealing with a mob attack, a shot of political revenge (or business) or directly with a state political assassination. This answer will come the hardest, because the latter option requires more substantial evidence than the participation of the Russian secret service at the assassination - planning and execution - although this would be sufficient and incriminating, once the collected data were not presented to their counterparts in Moldova. Let us see the testimony of those arrested, especially since it's harder now to wipe the traces by executing the concerned ones, a thing I would have expected if they returned to Ukraine after they had finished the job. Even those direct executors of the murder that had to be eliminated.</p>\r\n<p>The business relevance puts things differently. $ 200,000 is a significant amount even for the murder of Plahotniuc, but not a big one. A business rival could easily pay more than that, not necessarily for the same quality of performers. So the amount seems to indicate a real and sensible cost of the operation, which focuses rather on intelligence services and state money, used parsimoniously under the cover of ordering an assassination by a rival. And the option of a mob murder ordered strictly for reasons of criminal rivalry seems underpaid at this level. Criminal structures either own resources for such actions or pay generously the performers of such activities by importing them from other areas. However, they prefer snipers and clean execution, not involving representatives of the criminal world, which are many, talk much and are dispensable.</p>\r\n<p>That's why I think we are dealing with an implementation staged by structures of state secret intelligence services, with premeditated execution of those who would do the murder. The persons were dispensable, so I would have expected that, once returned to Ukraine, they would be killed. <strong>The amount used parsimoniously, the quality of executors - good, trained, dispensable, involved in the criminal world - indicates for me, rather, a state political assassination.</strong></p>\r\n<p>Therefore, we ask in conclusion: why would Vladimir Putin order the assassination of Plahotniuc? Could the order come from the lower levels, possibly from those who lost money in the Platon's laundry? Or from those who are still blocked there today? I think a FSB / GRU general could order such an assassination, if would have 1-2 billion dollars blocked in the laundry, with Platon in prison in Chisinau. And the rupture component Chisinau / Kiev following the arrival of assassins from Ukraine could easily justify the personal action as a state operation.</p>\r\n<p>The fact is that we must acknowledge today's instruments of a hybrid war, when military instruments are combined with the informational ones and companies are attacked as a whole, not only the armies or states. Including the use of special operations and criminal world, mob and organized crime. Moreover, <strong>Chisinau should realize that it's at war</strong>, there is no forgiveness or patience and - especially - <strong>on the land are thrown all the instruments</strong>! Where comes the need for consistency of action or strategical orientation in Chisinau and state structures and political cohesion. Therefore I find guilty Dodon's loud nonsense with taken pro-Russian positions. You don't fight unarmed with the enemy who is about to pull the trigger.</p>",

                "Continut": "<p class=\"zw-paragraph\" data-doc-rid=\"5s0qse6b9d02fd7344456be22c7087679c5dd\">Eu m-am gândit la soarta femeilor de la sat. În general soarta satelor este una prăpădită, dar cred că femeile suferă cel mai mult. Am început să mă gândesc la femeile unei singure străzi, ca să-mi dau seama de tabloul întreg al localității. În Antonești, dar și în alte sate, femeile au servicii în cele câteva instituții ale satului: primărie, școală, spital, poștă. La care se mai adaugă câteva magazine, o farmacie. Restul femeilor fie sunt plecate la muncă în străinătate, fie sunt pensionare, fie își așteaptă soții plecați și ei în străinătate. Pe lângă serviciile amintite, unele femei mai lucrează la munci sezoniere, de exemplu la viile vinăriei Purcari.</p>\r\n<p class=\"zw-paragraph\">Dar să încerc să enumăr ocupațiile femeilor de pe o singură stradă, luând-o de la un capăt:</p>\r\n<p class=\"zw-paragraph\">- deriticatoare la spitalul din centrul raional</p>\r\n<p class=\"zw-paragraph\">- șomeră (ex-funcționară la primărie)</p>\r\n<p class=\"zw-paragraph\">- la muncă în Portugalia</p>\r\n<p class=\"zw-paragraph\">- pensionară (ex-profesoară)</p>\r\n<p class=\"zw-paragraph\">- divorțată, la muncă în Italia</p>\r\n<p class=\"zw-paragraph\">- divorțată, la muncă în Italia</p>\r\n<p class=\"zw-paragraph\">- casă goală</p>\r\n<p class=\"zw-paragraph\">- pensionară, ex-muncitoare în colhoz</p>\r\n<p class=\"zw-paragraph\">- casă goală</p>\r\n<p class=\"zw-paragraph\">- fără femei</p>\r\n<p class=\"zw-paragraph\">- fără femei</p>\r\n<p class=\"zw-paragraph\">- la muncă în Rusia</p>\r\n<p class=\"zw-paragraph\">- fără femei</p>\r\n<p class=\"zw-paragraph\">- casă goală</p>\r\n<p class=\"zw-paragraph\">- la muncă în străinătate</p>\r\n<p class=\"zw-paragraph\" data-textformat=\"{\">- pensionară, ex-muncitoare în colhoz</p>\r\n<p class=\"zw-paragraph\" data-textformat=\"{\">- la munci sezoniere la vinăria Purcari</p>\r\n<p class=\"zw-paragraph\" data-textformat=\"{\">- pensionară, ex-muncitoare în colhoz</p>\r\n<p class=\"zw-paragraph\" data-textformat=\"{\">- pensionară, ex-muncitoare în colhoz</p>\r\n<p class=\"zw-paragraph\" data-textformat=\"{\">etc.</p>\r\n<p class=\"zw-paragraph\" data-textformat=\"{\">Cam ăsta e tabloul. Majoritatea femeilor sunt pensionare la sat, cu pensii foarte mici desigur, cât să-și plătească facturile. Urmează femeile plecate în străinătate, o parte dintre ele deja divorțate, că nu poți avea o căsnicie la distanță. Cele din străinătate, în mare parte, nu vor avea pensie, pentru că în general muncesc la negru. Sunt multe case în care nu mai trăiește nimeni, sunt case unde nu mai sunt femei. Am putea spune că satele moldovenești sunt acum în tranziție. Dar ce se va întâmpla cu ele după tranziție. La orizont nu apare nimic roz.</p>\r\n<p>Desigur că ne-am putea întreba de ce sătenii, cu femeile lor, nu-și fac afaceri locale. Unii își fac, cât să supraviețuiască, iar alții nu îndrăznesc, pentru că statul moldovenesc nu-i încurajează. Oamenilor le e frică să nu se trezească în situația bărbatului care a investit într-o fermă, apoi a adus rezultatul, adică niște purcei, la parlament. Atât. Atât și despre soarta femeii la sat.</p>",

                "lead": "The representative of OSCE for Transnistrian settlement, Franco Frattini - Silvio Berlusconi's former minister of foreign affairs and a great friend of his former counterpart Sergey Lavrov - is to arrive to Chisinau these days.  What will the special representative find at the mission dedicated to monitoring, resolving and preventing escalation of violence in the Eastern districts of the Republic of Moldova?",
                "Continut": "<p><strong>Between the Withdrawal of Troops and Munitions and Minding Business in Gagauzia</strong></p>\r\n<p>The visit was preceded by the official representative of the OSCE Chairman, Alfredo Conte, who, while on the official visit in the Republic of Moldova, discussed in Comrat with bashkan Irina Vlah the status and prerogatives of Gagauzia and had a visit to Tiraspol. According to deschide.md, Conte spoke in favour of full functioning of Gagauz autonomy based on Law from 1994 on the special status of the region.  This would make the state stronger and would prove the presence of democratic values in the country. Naturally, Conte had a meeting with the Deputy Prime-minister for Reintegration, Cristina Lesnic, who has just started her mandate. Conte spoke about the need to consolidate the connections between the ethnicities that live in the country and create a tolerant society.</p>\r\n<p>On the other hand, on the side of the Munich Security Conference, which took place on February 16-18, Minister of Foreign Affairs and European Integration,Tudor Ulianovschi, had a discussion with the Secretary General of OSCE, Ambassador Thomas Greminger. They spoke, among other, about the problematics of Transnistrian conflict settlement and consolidation of the OSCE mandate in the Republic of Moldova, as well as of the specific ways to advance the dynamics of Transnistrian case, under the commitments of parties involved in the dialog, and priority attention that the Republic of Moldova pays to withdrawal of Russian troops and munitions stationed on the left bank of Nistru, underscoring the importance of support provided by the Organization in this sense.</p>\r\n<p><strong>OSCE Mission and Scanlan in Control: Key Objectives of the Mandate Failed</strong></p>\r\n<p>In this context, let us examine what Franco Fratini will find in Chisinau when he subjects the already eternal Head of OSCE Mission in Moldova, Michael Scanlan, to careful scrutiny. That is because the preliminary agenda of the conference also originates in the messages sent by Scanlan to OSCE, his reports, as well as weapons control programs and other elements related to the OSCE Mission in Chisinau, implemented, more or less, by the Head of the Mission in the Republic of Moldova, who is American by origin.</p>\r\n<p>Thus, Fratini finds an OSCE Mission that does not have the capacity to implement its mandate, looking for activities and getting into the elements that have not been coordinated with the host state and are not the object of its mission. Thus, only the Head of the Mission in Chisinau can freely travel to the left bank of Nistru (and even he needs to notify about the visit), and the rest of the team cannot do their job of monitoring the zone of conflict and the actions in the separatist region, supporting the Republic of Moldova - member of OSCE, in the place of accreditation.  Not a single member of the mission can cross Nistru without explicit agreement of separatist pseudo-authorities.</p>\r\n<p>It is one thing that there is a prohibition, though we have not heard Scanlan cry out as loud as he could about the problem and emphasizing it at all OSCE reunions or 5+2 meetings, at all meetings he has with diplomats and officials of the member states. Moreover, he does not even take any effort to accomplish the mission in the Republic of Moldova. We have not seen a single inspection report or at least an attempt to inspect the condition of weapons and munitions on the left bank of Nistru. Have you seen anything like that since Scanlan came to Chisinau? Have you seen an outcome or at least a declaration of his presence at inspection of weapons stored in Cobasna? Not even the smallest complaint, not a squeak about the fact that he was not allowed to get in. Nothing!</p>\r\n<p><strong>Scanlan Looks Aside When There Are Military Exercises of Separatist, Russian and Pretended \"Peace-Keeping\" Troops.</strong></p>\r\n<p>The same Scanlan who has not had a slightest reaction to the last year's about one military exercise of the troops on the left bank of Nistru per day on average, to the exercise of cooperation and interoperability between the separatists and Russian peace-keepers and troops of the OGRT illegally stationed on the left bank of Nistru, to the participation of the pretended \"peace-keepers\" that have not been validated as such by anyone?</p>\r\n<p>He has not protested against the offensive military exercises with the separatists' troops - troops that are in conflict and the pretended peace-keepers should keep them separate from the legitimate and regulated troops of the Republic of Moldova, showing impartiality, a mandatory condition for any peace keeping mission - he has not called indignant press-conferences, he has not notified Vienna and General Secretariat, he has not even made a report, though this is what his mission in Chisinau consists in.</p>\r\n<p>All right, Scanlan is dealing in minding one's own business, if possible on the right side of Nistru, in the area, which is under control of legitimate authorities where he can travel freely, with no hindrance. I will not go into details on other much more human concerns of the diplomat, who, by the way, is far from being at a very young age, when the vapours of alcohol or hormones can play foul tricks on you. It is his business. However, is it the right thing to do to apply pressure just on Chisinau, asking for unilateral concessions not to upset Russia and because Tiraspol does not commit to anything, just for the sake of marking activity?</p>\r\n<p>Maybe it is on the mandate of the OSCE Mission in the Republic of Moldova - or it is planned for a future mandate being conceived these days - that the mission has to take care of minorities in the Republic of Moldova, particularly the Russian one - super represented among the leaders of the state institutions, which is not the case of the discriminated majority Romanians or those who have Romanian citizenship (by the way, here I have also not seen any concern, or at least a report)? As for Gagauzia, after he resolved the separatism on Nistru, does he want to tackle the Gagauz one? A mission, a contact point in Comrat maybe?</p>\r\n<p><strong>Scanlan, a Disappointment and a Failed Mission, After an Utterly Ridiculous Mandate</strong></p>\r\n<p>I do not even want to talk here about priority and interest explicitly declared at the highest level by the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Secretary General of the OSCE - withdrawal of troops and munitions from the eastern districts of the Republic of Moldova. Have you heard anything? Any position, any support, at least the fact that the mission in Chisinau took note of these wishes, let alone getting involved in solving them, providing legal and logistic support or promoting these positions with third countries?</p>\r\n<p>Mr Scanlan forgot his mandate and the task he has in Chisinau, and particularly in the Republic of Moldova, the mandate concerning occupation troops, separatism, prohibition of free movement of citizens of the Republic of Moldova, particularly officials, on the left bank of Nistru. Weapons, military movements, offensive assault and river fording exercises, here is where the mission would have had a job to do, should that have been a concern for its head.   Scanlan accomplished nothing of what his mandate is. In order not to leave any pending questions, we could always run a comparative analysis with the OSCE Mission in Kiev, present substantially, together with its leaders, at the demarcation line and in the separatist zone in Donetsk and Donbas, having important accomplishments. So, it is possible, and they are also facing separatists and Russians.</p>\r\n<p>It is clear that Scanlan indulged too much in life in Chisinau, with the pleasures of the life of a diplomat who does not have much to do in a capital, be it a capital of an Eastern country, where one can find a decent restaurant, some friends for a conversation and beautiful women to admire. I am not talking about the people around, experts and older employees of the mission, knowledgeable of the routine, who ran away because of the wonderful job Scanlan is doing. I do not want to go into details of management, people, budgets, money. It is the job of the OSCE audit. The Secretariat is to run a substantial inspection.</p>\r\n<p><strong>OSCE Mission has Fully Failed Human Rights Monitoring on the Left Bank of Nistru</strong></p>\r\n<p>Scanlan spent too much time in Chisinau. He forgot about his tasks, he does not follow a single point of his mandate, but does force relations with the authorities from the old provincial positions, looking for missions other than the ones established upon his arrival to Chisinau. Should we bring up the crime of a 1st of January against an innocent citizen of the Republic of Moldova? It would be useless. However, something has to be mentioned as it is the most severe problem of the OSCE Mission in the Republic of Moldova. Human Rights.</p>\r\n<p>I have not left it for the final part because I forgot about it. I could not. The \"red lines\" are defended by a coalition that has the same name and public reports appear periodically, and Promo Lex, the last non-governmental organization to do its job on the left bank of Nistru, brought up the situation of human rights in the eastern districts of the Republic of Moldova on several occasions.  Have you seen an OSCE report, a report of the mission headed by Scanlan about the human rights situation in the separatist region? Have you ever heard of a trip that Scanlan made to the left bank of Nistru to take care of a complaint in this sense? Have you seen a recent report on human rights situation that would not be made by the office in Chisinau? Have you ever heard about a visit to a prison where the abuse hurls injustice and where people have no support whatsoever?</p>\r\n<p>Nooooo...of course not. Scanlan is taking care of the OSCE's tasks in warm offices, seeing to the way the authorities in Chisinau work with the minorities, studying the rights of Comrat and Gagauzia, bashkan being the member of the Government and the autonomy given by People's Assembly functioning in Russian, in Comrat. Because he can do it, it is simple and guaranteed by the granted rights and security guarantees, as well as by the authority of the Government of the Republic of Moldova.  It is where there is work to do and where it is tough, where the OSCE and its mission in the Republic of Moldova must act, that Scanlan did nothing.</p>\r\n<p>Well, this is what Fratini should see and should know when he comes to Chisinau. He should pull Scanlan's ears or forelock and send him home. But home for ever, with a low score for behaviour and far from bringing bad luck on another mission in another country in this wide world. He should retire or do some field work, if possible. He brought too much shame on OSCE, the mandate of an ambassador and even the whole of American school of diplomacy.</p>\r\n<p> </p>",
