The reasons are clear to all citizens of the country, who want to live in a sovereign and independent state, while this person has declared repeatedly that recognizes no independence and no sovereignty of the Republic of Moldova. Despite this, the Moldovan President Nicolae Timofti has granted to the former President of Romania the Moldovan citizenship \"in the interests\" of our country. We qualify this act as a humiliation to our state and people, so I contested that decree, demanding to recognise this act as an unconstitutional one and its abolition,\"</em>explained the deputy from the Socialist Party, Vladimir Turcan.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>The PSRM deputy, Vlad Batrincea, mentioned that the initiation of proceedings before the Constitutional Court was signed by four socialist deputies, and the first signature at the end of the text belongs to the formation's president, Igor Dodon, who is the author of this abolition idea of Timofti's decree.</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p><em>\"Basescu declared several statements against the statehood of the Republic of Moldova. The Moldovan citizenship was granted to him in an unconstitutional way, that is why we ask to recognize the anticonstitutional characteristic of this decree.

                "Continut": "<p><strong>With the most important national holiday when we celebrate 25 years of independence approaching, the Prime Minister Pavel Filip gave an interview to the portal Deschide.MD. The interview’s author proposed to “filter” the notion of independence through both the vision of the citizen Pavel Filip and the Prime Minister of the Republic of Moldova. I have not left unapproached the social-political topics that after the festive ceremony and military parade will become again priorities in the government coalition.</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>On August 27, we are celebrating a quarter of century since the Republic of Moldova is an independent state. Where was Pavel Filip on August 27, 1991? How remained in your memory those events?</strong></p>\r\n<p>I remember that time as if it was yesterday: I was 25 and I was a young man, in Chisinau, very set on work, on great deeds: beyond the usual schedule, I celebrated with my loved ones, friends, the historical moment. They were days loaded with symbol, all great hopes of a new beginning were being expressed, it was a general feeling of joy in the air and expectation of another world.</p>\r\n<p><strong>During those 25 years of independence, our country faced a deep identity crisis. How many citizenships do you have and which is closer to your soul?</strong></p>\r\n<p>I have the citizenship of the Republic of Moldova and the Romanian one. The citizenship of the soul is of course the one of the country where you were born. However, I feel very close to the Romanian nation, both through close people I interact with there and through the relationship with the state institutions there and the support Romania constantly grants to Moldova.</p>\r\n<p><strong>What sentiments felt the citizen Pavel Filip on the “inauguration night”, on January 20?</strong></p>\r\n<p>Contradictory. This is not because of how the government was inaugurated, but because to me it was clear then, what many find out just now - that behind those protests were several individuals and provocateurs who represented certain interest groups, including abroad. There were some people who were playing with the citizens’ legitimate discontent: it was normal for people to be unhappy, but it is not normal to see how the sense of the protest is filled up with bad faith. The embarrassing circus in the Parliament was not a natural reaction of society, but a manifestation of a hysterical behavior, which was part of the plan that continued in the street with those assaults and violent demonstrations. For me it was harder that I had to take a decision very quickly, to accept or not this function; it is a function that I never wanted and I tell you directly that it is not a function that gives me the professional comfort that I want. However, I understand perfectly what it means to be a statesman, not a simple politician, and to be at the helm when the historical moment requires a steady hand for stabilization and reforms. I probably have certain prejudices, after this function has been highly politicized lately. I see the Prime Minister position mostly outside the politics, rather in the institutional management and that is what I try to do: less politics, more efficient administration and institutional organization.</p>\r\n<p><strong>What are the most valuable advices that you have received in the last six months from your sons and wife?</strong></p>\r\n<p>They enjoy to see me and to talk about anything else except Government. Things have changed since I became Prime Minister, the time for the family has reduced, but I am trying to make the time I have with them more valuable.</p>\r\n<p>It is very clear however that in this position you must be persevering. You have to push things forward in terms of resistance to change within the system; and on the other hand are scarce resources, the needs are great and complaints are inevitable. However, the Government should not bother trying to change things, to explain what it does, to talk to all social categories and present them what can be done now and what will be possible later. No matter how complicated it would be for the government, I never forget that it is harder for ordinary people, who still have small pensions, small salaries.</p>\r\n<p><strong>How independent do you feel?</strong></p>\r\n<p>I think I am the Prime Minister with the most freedom in actions after 2009. Moreover, I do not say it as it would be my merit; the merit is firstly of the team, coalition colleagues, who understood that the Government can work effectively only if it is allowed to work freely and is supported politically.</p>\r\n<p><strong>What you want to associate your name with in the history of the next 25 years of independence. If there will be independence…</strong></p>\r\n<p>I am not looking for a place in the history; I do not have such objectives. In the history does not remain who wants, but those who change things, I want to have prosperity in activity and results, along with my colleagues, that is all. I would like the actual Government to be the one that laid the foundation of the first radical transformations and started the modernization of Moldova. I want it to remain as a reformist government. I know it is not easy, I know what difficulties are created by reforms, but there is no other way if we want to evolve. I think that so far we have proved we are the government of facts, respecting his word. I believe that time will prove that we are the government of good deeds. In addition, I would want that the regained trust of Moldovans in Moldova could partly be associated with this government.</p>\r\n<p><strong>You are proposing to make the most extensive Central Public Administration reform from all 25 years of independence. You want the reduction of 4 ministries and more governmental agencies. When will happen this thing?</strong></p>\r\n<p>I begin with the main idea that we have a state that should serve its people, not the people exist to support the state bureaucracy. Now we have discussions in the government and coalition and will come out publicly on the subject of the Central Public Administration reform, only after having a clear vision and an optimal calendar: the official announcement will not be late, it will be made in September. The final organization chart is not yet ready; we are working on it, because we wanted to involve local and abroad experts, so this reform will bring more efficiency. It is an extremely complicated proceeding that takes time. I hope that in the near future, we will have final discussions with the parliamentary majority, then we can move to implementation. Realistically, I think a start period of actual implementation would be in January 2017; until then we must finalize preparations for these major institutional changes. This action is absolutely necessary, the current structure is outdated and cumbersome, we must adapt to current needs.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Development partners welcomed the steps that the Filip Government took to reach a new agreement with the IMF. However, some of the required reforms will be very tough. What are most complicated actions that you have taken during the negotiations of this agreement?</strong></p>\r\n<p>The agreement with IMF is not always simple, but what we assumed, we will achieve. I saw that there are already “visionary” voices, which already know we will not achieve what we assume; these are the people led by impressions and probably by that bankrupt dream, as Moldova will fail. Moldova will not fail, we will have an agreement with IMF, and we will do what we assumed, because we need this agreement firstly as a reform plan and actions necessary to economic and social equilibration. The main commitments are related to the banking sector, where we should intervene to strengthen it and create the circumstances that will not allow the situations we had in the past. It is complicated what we have to do, but everything is achievable when there is political will. I avoid now to give retorts to those who do not believe in signing the agreement with the IMF, they are the same who said that we would not be able to start negotiations and they were wrong. We will continue to respond by results, not by useless polemics. People are tired of polemics; they want to see actions and results.</p>\r\n<p class=\"yiv9169453036msonormal\"><strong>In the past two years, the independence of the country was under constant risk of an economic crisis caused by fraud in the banking system. In the autumn, we will see if the stolen “billion” will fall or not on the shoulders of citizens. If deputies will oppose this project, will the Government find alternative?</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"yiv9169453036msonormal\">The project is in Parliament in the only form that can be implemented under current conditions, modeled on that used by several European countries in crises at certain banks. If the deputies will come up with other solutions, we will surely analyze them. I told those from the opposition to leave demagogic speeches on this subject and come up with a better solution if they have one. We are open to analyze any constructive proposal.</p>\r\n<p><strong>One of the problems that has faced Moldova in all its years of independence was energy security. How soon you see our country's interconnection to the Romanian energy system?</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"yiv9169453036msonormal\">This is a strategic project for Moldova, as well as natural gas network interconnection project. It is a project that we are still working on, but it is a fact that the overall funds available for investment were lower last year. Economic problems in 2015 have led Moldova to focus on absolutely vital investments like schools, hospitals and roads. With the economic recovery that we foresee for this year, the budget will allocate larger amounts for projects that slowed down lately. Good news is the quality of bilateral relations with Romania, Cioloş PM’s visit was a great bilateral success, we will see results after the political signal.</p>\r\n<p class=\"yiv9169453036msonormal\">Meanwhile, concrete steps are taken but constantly, including the recently held meeting of the Intergovernmental Commission of Moldova - Romania, Working group on energy. There is an ongoing feasibility study; a cooperation agreement was signed between Moldelectrica and Transelectrica. We will speed up steps, while being aware that it is a project for many years and it is part of the overall national effort to connect the country to the infrastructure in the European Union.</p>\r\n<p class=\"yiv9169453036msonormal\"><strong>Another problem that milled permanently the stability in Moldova was generated by the constant tensions with the Transnistrean region. How do you see the situation improving in the current geopolitical conjuncture?</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"yiv9169453036msonormal\">Such situations are resolved only through dialogue, but an active and constructive dialogue. It is a sensitive subject, which is why it must be resolved at the negotiating table. From our side there is the will to advance the negotiations.</p>\r\n<p class=\"yiv9169453036msonormal\">However, I would like to point out that the situation on the Dniester is stable and permanent objective of any government in Chisinau is this stability. We want to have as normal as possible relations, to have a better circulation of people and goods. Therefore, our efforts in the area of diplomacy will continue, we hope to progress all the time and we never give up the goal of reunifying the country.</p>\r\n<p class=\"yiv9169453036msonormal\"><strong>The messages of the Russian Federation submitted through military applications on the Dniester, recruitment at our home, many polling stations in Transnistria, high-ranking visits in Tiraspol and a lot more, becoming more aggressive. You recently wrote about this pressure and the increasing Russian propaganda in your editorial from The Hill. What do you expect from external partners on this matter and what you intend to do to counteract the phenomena that you have described?</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"yiv9169453036msonormal\">Foreign partners can help in their role as mediators, they can help with expertise, but they cannot solve these problems alone. That is why I said it is important to communicate actively and be really sincere in the desire to advance the negotiations.</p>\r\n<p class=\"yiv9169453036msonormal\">At the same time, we will continue to present to our European and American partners the developments in the field, so they would have an accurate knowledge of reality and to our diplomatic efforts to add the diplomatic efforts of the European Union. We count and we will continue to count on constant interest of EU diplomacy and national diplomacies of some important EU countries to maintain peace on the continent, and on the significant ability of these diplomats to stimulate the dialogue, to mediate between the parties. America is also a reliable partner with whom we want to build more, not incidentally we communicated frequently through international Anglo-Saxon media.</p>\r\n<p class=\"yiv9169453036msonormal\"><strong>Have you thought about how will you arrange relations with the next president if he comes from the left-wing?</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"yiv9169453036msonormal\">No matter where will the next president come from and who will he be, I think he must be a man of dialogue, an institutional man with respect for the Constitution, and a man who should be able to represent the country at the highest level. I'm sure that people do not want a conflictual President, a man who will come and start institutional wars and throw the country into a deep political crisis. We need at least a few years of stability to put us on track definitively. I will have a constructive relationship with the future president, an institutional right one, that of course if he will be a man who will want this and comes in this position to work, not to represent different interest groups or certain interests outside the country. I think Moldovans will elect the president as they wish, a Moldovan who will represent them, not someone else's interests in their country.</p>\r\n<p class=\"yiv9169453036msonormal\">It is certain, however, that the government's commitment to modernize the country and to support the European vector will be maintained after the presidential election. Moldova has an Association Agreement with the EU, is implementing this agreement, and whoever is elected president will have to take into account this. The Government I manage is the guarantee of European road, regardless of the outcome of the presidential election.</p>\r\n<p class=\"yiv9169453036msonormal\"><strong>Mr. Diacov told Free Europe that your name is one of the three discussed by the party for the presidential election? To what extent would you like to change the Prime Minister seat on the President one?</strong></p>\r\n<p class=\"yiv9169453036msonormal\">My name was not discussed on the official level in the party. I don’t know to what referred Mr. Diacov, probably to some surveys, not something concrete.</p>\r\n<p>I personally think I can make a maximum contribution by still working in the government. On the other hand, there are many other colleagues who are eligible and can handle honorably and skillfully the president position. Shortly, PDM will come up with a decision that is for sure.</p>",

U.S. Ambassador in Chisinau, James Pettit, makes theories similar to those of Stalin and Putin's propaganda, offering to Moscow invaluable services by giving a strong hit to the historical realities and supporting the mystification of Romanian history, stating that: \"</em><em>Moldova is not Romania\"; \"Moldova has its own history\"; \"Joining Romania is not a practical choice and is not a choice that would make things better here, in Moldova\"; \"It is important for Moldovans to recognise themselves as Moldovans, a separate nation\"; \"Moldova, a multi-ethnic country\"; \"Transnistria should have a special status\"\"</em>; wrote Traian Basescu on Facebook.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>He added that he found out from James Pettit that \"we and the citizens of the Republic of Moldova speak different languages\".</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p><em>\"In other words, U.S. Ambassador in Chisinau strengthens the theory promoted by Stalin and nowadays by Putin, not taking into account the history of Romania. The big question is if the Ambassador James Pettit stated the official USA's opinion or, simply the said words show the misknowledge of the space where he fulfills hs duty. I do not know if James Pettit </em><em>expresses the point of view of USA, but the Ambassador just managed to spread a thick layer of perplexity and the seed of suspicion of Romania is USA\", thinks the eader of PMP</em></p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>Traian Basescu shows that the statement of the Ambassador James Pettit is a<em> \"a rough insult to the Romanian history\".</em></p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p><em>\"An official and clarifying reaction from Romania to USA is required\", also says the PMP leader.</em></p>\r\n<p>James Pettit, the Ambassador of the United States of America to the Republic of Moldova stated in an interview given to the TV channel Moldova 1,  that the country should remain an independent and sovereign state.</p>\r\n<p><em>\" <em>I consider that it is very important, of course,  it is our policy, I think it is the policy over here too. Moldova should remain a sovereign and independent state within secure borders. Joining Romania for example, as a way to enter the EU or any other reason, is not a practical choice and is not a choice that would make things better here, in Moldova\"</em>, said the United States of America ambassador in the Republic of Moldova.  </em></p>\r\n<p><em>\"Moldova is not Romania, Moldova has its own history and its own challenges, like the fact that Moldova is a multi-ethnic country with people that speak different languages and, of course, there is the Transnistrian problem, which is not even under the control of a central government, but needs a special status, hence a special status in the Republic of Moldova\"</em>, also mentioned James Pettit, stating that the potential is huge.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n</blockquote>",

It is very unfortunate that His Excellency makes such statements that ot only affect the sovereignty of the Republic of Moldova and the right of the citizens to decide their future, but reminds us the strategy of Imperial Russian diplomacy, that through the infamous Ambassador Kuzmin, interfered in the identity concerns in the Republic of Moldova, saying what books should we use, what language to speak, and, generally, how to identify us as a nation.</em></p>\r\n<p><em>From the position of a former temporary President of the Republic of Moldova, that signed, with the former President of Romania, the Joint Declaration to Establish a Strategic Partnership between Romania and the Republic of Moldova for the European Integration of the Republic of Moldova (signed in Bucharest on April 27, 2010), I state, firmly, that the Republic of Moldova has no chance for modernization, development and European integration without the mother country, Romania. The European path of the Republic of Moldova passes through Bucharest\"</em>, noted Mihai Ghimpu.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>PL leader also says that the statements of the Ambassador are more questionable, especially when are being said in the context of aprroaching presidential elections in the Republic of Moldova.</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p><em>\"It is unhappy and incorrect for an ambassador to suggest to the future political candidates what identity project they should assume. What concerns me, with all due respect for His Excellency James Pettit, the State Department and the american nation, whome he represents in the Republic of Moldova, I stated, state and will state firmly, as my grandparents, my parents and my brothers taught me, Moldova is Romania, beacuse we speak the same language, have the same identity and Romania was formed by Moldova and Muntenia, who were then joined by Basarabia, the lower part of Moldova and Transilvania that were occupied by Russia and Austria-Hungary</em>\", concluded the politician.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>We remind you that a few days ago, in an interview given to the public TV channel Moldova 1, the United States of America Ambassador to the Republic of Moldova stated that \"joining Romania for example, as a way to enter the EU or any other reason, is not a practical choice and is not a choice that would make things better here, in Moldova\".

Our unionists have gone crazy\"</em>, noted Dodon, reminding that \"the Republic of Moldova is an independent state, UN member, recognised worldwide\" </p>\r\n<p><em>\"And I would want each ambassador from our country to point out this thing in their statements, <em>which, by the way, was also noted and accepted by the Romanian ambassador in the Republic of Moldova at the meeting I had with him</em>\", </em>pointed out the PSRM leader.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>Dodon thinks that \"the unionism should be banned by law\", because it is \"outside and against the Constitution\".</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p><em>\"If we got to be criticized for the fact that we consider and declare ourselves a sovereign, independent and separate <em>state</em> from the others, means that our joke with unionism thickened\"</em>, tied up the socialist.</p>\r\n<p>\n\t\t\t<div class=\"cs_img \"  style=\"width:467px;\">\n\t\t\t <p><a href=\"/images/cms-image-000000258.jpg\" class=\"photoViewer\" title=\"\"> \t\t\t\t<img src=\"/get_img?ImageWidth=467&amp;ImageHeight=225&amp;ImageId=258\"   border=\"0\"/>\n\t\t\t </a></p> \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\n</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>In turn,<strong> the honorary President of the Democratic Party, Dumitru Diacov,</strong> shares the critical opinion of the U.S. ambassador in Chisinau towards the union of the Republic of Moldova with Romania.</p>\r\n<p>Diacov is convinced that the same point of view share all the ambassadors of the EU member-states from Chisinau.</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p><em>\"What said the U.S. ambassador in Moldova, James Pettit,<em> were saying </em>all the EU member-states' ambassadors, and be sure that they reflect the point of view of the governments from those countries. They, as the absolute majority of Moldovans want the Republic of Moldova to consolidate its statehood, to be a democratic country, prosperous and be in good and friendly relations with Romania. No one would accept frontier changes in this part of Europe!\"</em>, commented Diacov.</p>\r\n<p>\n\t\t\t<div class=\"cs_img \"  style=\"width:460px;\">\n\t\t\t <p><a href=\"/images/cms-image-000000257.jpg\" class=\"photoViewer\" title=\"\"> \t\t\t\t<img src=\"/get_img?ImageWidth=460&amp;ImageHeight=210&amp;ImageId=257\"   border=\"0\"/>\n\t\t\t </a></p> \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\n</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>In an interview given to the public TV channel, the american diplomat stated that \"Moldova should remain a sovereign and independent state within secure borders\".</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p><em>\"I consider that it is very important, of course,  it is our policy, I think it is the policy over here too. Moldova should remain a sovereign and independent state within secure borders. Joining Romania for example, as a way to enter the EU or any other reason, is not a practical choice and is not a choice that would make things better here, in Moldova\"</em>, said the United States of America ambassador in the Republic of Moldova.  </p>\r\n<p><em>\"Moldova is not Romania, Moldova has its own history and its own challenges, like the fact that Moldova is a multi-ethnic country with people that speak different languages and, of course, there is the Transnistrian problem, which is not even under the control of a central government, but needs a special status, hence a special status in the Republic of Moldova\"</em>, also mentioned James Pettit, stating that the potential is huge.</p>\r\n</blockquote>",

I wont to come with a very clear message to the candidates of the left and right opposition: we have whom to fight, not each other.

                "Continut": "<p><strong>The words <em>corruption</em> or <em>inefficiency</em> appear at least once at intervals of three pages in the report of the European Court of Auditors (ECA) regarding the audit on the financing of Republic of Moldova during 2007-2015. </strong></p>\r\n<p>Published on Thursday, the <em>special report</em> of ECA points out that <em>\"they found only limited evidence showing the EU aid had contributed effectively\" </em>regarding EU financial support to Moldova aimed at strengthening the country’s public administration. The poorest country in Europe, as named Moldova by ECA, received - since 2007 - financial aid amounting to €782 million which represents nearly €37 per inhabitant. This is <em>\"the highest amount among the EU’s eastern neighbours\"</em>, say the authors of the <em>special report.</em></p>\r\n<p><em>\"<em>The EU faces significant challenges in implementing assistance for Moldova\",</em></em> said Hans Gustaf Wessberg, the Member of the European Court of Auditors responsible for the report.</p>\r\n<p>The report makes numerous references to corruption. ECA reminds the disappearance of a billion euros from local banks and worsening of Moldova's position in the Corruption Perceptions Index published by Transparency International.</p>\r\n<p>To take a position after ECA's conlcusions, the European Commission points out that corruption hinders, generally, the achievement of targeted effects of the aid, while corruption is not limited to the general budget support programs.</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p><em>\"It is clear, however, that progress achieved in budget support programmes concerning financial controls  and public procurement can make a real contribution to reducing corruption\"</em>, the European Commission said in reply. </p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>The full report can be found below. We will provide expert opinions and a detailed analysis of the ECA report.</p>\r\n<p><iframe src=\"https://www.scribd.com/embeds/322832482/content?start_page=1&amp;view_mode=scroll&amp;access_key=key-YnopiVJF1KPz8BroSCWN&amp;show_recommendations=true\" width=\"100%\" height=\"600\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" id=\"doc_3472\" data-auto-height=\"false\" data-aspect-ratio=\"0.75\"></iframe></p>",

ECA reminds the disappearance of a billion euros from local banks and worsening of Moldova's position in the Corruption Perceptions Index published by Transparency International.</p>\r\n<p>To take a position after ECA's conlcusions, the European Commission points out that corruption hinders, generally, the achievement of targeted effects of the aid, while corruption is not limited to the general budget support programs.</p>\r\n<p> </p>",

There were many cases. On which of these topics did you notified the prosecution? Why I must inform the prosecution on all topics that have happened and all frauds that have happened over the years [...] Right now, it is an outrageous case and we are notifying the prosecution [...] I can not answer for my actions and if you can bring me a case in which i influenced someone from the educational system and prove me that, we will talk. I can assure you that I have not done political pressure on <em>any </em> employee in the educational system. </em></p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>We remind you that at the previous local and parliamentary elections, the press has written several times about the fact that PLDM used its administrative sources in election campaigns. </p>\r\n<p>You can see below the video from the today press conference of the PAS leader, Maia Sandu:</p>\r\n<p><iframe src=\"http://www.privesc.eu/widget/live/68671\" width=\"758\" height=\"370\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>",

Pettit mentioned on this occasion that he respects \"the ideals and decision of the unionists\".</strong></p>\r\n<p>In a Press release published on the Liberal Party's site, it's says that the meeting was held in the context of closeness of the campaign for the presidential elections in the Republic of Moldova from October 30 2016.</p>\r\n<p>Mihai Ghimpu told the US Ambassador about historical events of the Romanian people, that prove that the population from both sides of the Prut is the same, and the independence of Moldova \"was nothing for me, but a step closer to UNION\".</p>\r\n<p>Mihai Ghimpu mentioned that at the moment, there are two sides - pros and cons - on this matter, because we did not have a Government that would correct the mistakes of the history.</p>\r\n<p>When answering to the US Ambassador's questions about national minorities, Mihai Ghimpu mentioned that the minorities, enjoy all rights and in the case of unification, they will benefit from European rights, Romania being a leader on the matter of minority rights in the Community space. </p>\r\n<p>I order to bring closer the two sides of the Prut, the future President must assure energy security (the ongoing construction of gas pipeline Iasi-Ungheni-Chisinau and interconnection of Isaccea - Vulcanesti - Chisinau, Iasi - Ungheni - Straseni, Suceava - Balti power grids, as well as construction of back-to-back stations for each grid), also the reconstruction of bridges over the Prut river and a European gauge railway: Iasi-Chisinau, among other things.  </p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p><em>\"The decision of where to go belongs to the people, and no one can point out to us what to do and whom to unite. Blood is thicker than the water, Mr. Ambassador\", said Ghimpu.</em></p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>We remind you that the Ambassador of United States of America in Moldova, James Pettit, stated in a interview for Moldova 1 that the country must remain an independent and sovereign state. The Official considers that unification with Romania, for example, as a way to enter Europe or any other reasons, \"is not a practical choice and not a choice that will make things better here in Moldova\".</p>\r\n<p><em>\"Moldova is not Romania, Moldova has its own history and its own challenges, among which is the fact that Moldova is a multiethnic country, where people talk different languages and, of course there is also the Transnistrian problem, which is not even controlled by the central Government, but which needs a special status, but a special status within Moldova \", also mentioned Pettit. </em></p>\r\n<p> </p>",

At the moment things remain unchanged in relation to the Partnership Agreement and the appointment of <em>Mr. Leanca</em> as the President of the Parliamentary European Integration Council\", declared the speaker.</em></p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>When asked about the legal power of this agreement, if PL members from the Permanent Bureau will change their decision, Andrian Candu said:</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p><em>\"It is too early to talk about this. We will call together a new meeting of the Bureau and we will see how things are. There is a procedure... until then I bet on the wisdom of every political actor involved no matter they are in the electoral campaign and this thing <em>somehow</em> justifies some radical decisions\", concluded Andrian Candu. </em></p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>We remind you that today the Liberal Party announced that is withdrawing its signature from the Partnership Agreement with PPEM.</p>\r\n<p>In turn, the President of PPEM, Iurie Leanca, said that \"if Mr. Ghimpu thought that this agreement was a political game for canceling the referendum, he would do the right thing to withdraw his signature when found out that it is not like that\".</p>\r\n<p>The Partnership Agreement between the parliamentary majority was signed at the end of the summer parliamentary session. A couple of days ago, Mihai Ghimpu declared in an interview for the \"Puterea a patra\" show that if PPEM municipal counselors does not give up the idea of the referendum for Dorin Chirtoaca's dismissal, then he will withdraw his signature \"from the partnership\" with Leanca. </p>",

At \"<strong>In PROfunzime\" TV show the leaders of the three parties said that the decision on the common nominee will be taken in late September, and Maia Sandu said that the exercise of selection will be based upon two internal surveys that are undertaken in this period.</strong></strong></p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p><em>\"Two parallel things are happening now. On one hand we are collecting signatures to be both eligible as long as we do not know who among us will be the joint candidate. At the same time <em>at least two polls </em>will be conducted  in which we trust all three as a team. We will find out the results by the end of September. We measure many things there: favorite candidate, option two, scenarios for the second round. These are the details we need in order to take an informed decision and to know how to talk to our voters. When we decide who is the candidate, we do not start from candidate's<em> A or B</em> whim, we start from people's perception\", </em>stated Maia Sandu.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>The leader of PLDM, when asked whom he will support, avoided to give a straight answer. <em>\"We continue our activity, we continue to explain to the people that it is more important for an unity to exist on the right wing\"</em>, he pointed out. Viorel Cibotaru states that PLDM is not collecting signatures for anyone now. <em>\"We discussed with the secretariat and decided that there is no need of <em>party's involvement</em> at the moment. When the candidate will be decided, that will also be the PLDM candidate\",</em> he said.</p>\r\n<p>The PAS leader, Maia Sandu, also mentioned that when we were speaking about the second mandate of Iurie Leanca, the PPEM President, he gave an advice - to not criticize Vlad Plahotniuc.</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p><em>\"If I am looking for a job, he is looking for a holiday destination. He was present only at two debates on the joint candidate and he cannot judge what was discussed there. I supported him when he was a Prime Minister, however I did not know he was discussing the problems from the banking system with Shor and Plahotniuc. At the moment I had believed he deserves a second mandate, he gave me an advice - to not criticize Vlad Plahotniuc. I was very surprised then. He said to me that he believes that Plahotniuc is the man who will develop this country and then I realized that we are thinking differently. Our paths parted there\", </em>afirms Maia Sandu.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>At the same TV show, PPDA leader announced that he already has over 17 thousands of signatures, while Maia Sandu - only 5 thousand of signatures. </p>\r\n<p>Immediately, after they announced the date of the presidential elections, PAS, PPEM, PLDM and PDA announced they would band together in the elections and will come up with a single candidate. Subsequently, PPEM withdrew and Iurie Leanca said he will run alone, and announced that PLDM will not have its own candidate however will support the common candidate.</p>",

In the situation of our captured state, this could provoke an unforeseeable evolution of the situation in the society... By the actions of the corrupted political persons, was destroyed the structure of the Parliament. Today, it does not longer represent the will expressed by the voter at the parliamentary elections on November 30th, 2014\"</em>, he stated.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>According to the leader of PCRM, <em>\"the capture of the leading bodies by non-professionals, sharing control over all economic and social structures led to a functional paralysis and, eventually became the main causes of the stagnation in the development of the economic potential\".</em></p>\r\n<p><em>\"The transition to the presidential system of government, in the case it will be demanded by the majority of the country's citizens, should be done in a constitutional manner, in this way to be ensured the legitimacy of the whole electoral process\"</em>, said Voronin.</p>\r\n<p>To this end the communists proposed:</p>\r\n<p><br /> <em>— To restore the structure of the <em>Parliament </em>in line with the will of the voters, to organize, by the end of 2016, anticipated parliamentary elections.</em></p>\r\n<p><em>— To return to the nation its sovereign rights by conducting in the first half of 2017 a constitutional referendum on changing the country's form of government.</em></p>\r\n<p>We remind you that, during the meeting of the Central Committee of PCRM on September 3rd, the party's management decided to boycott the presidential elections. </p>\r\n<p> </p>",

However, this would have been a too \"abrupt\" diplomatic message in relation with the lack of interest of the Republic of Moldova towards the CIS states community and especially - towards Russian Federation. During the last visit in Chisinau, Russian Deputy Minister Dmitrii Rogozin requested more presence from Chisinau at the events concerning bilateral relations with Russian Federation.</p>\r\n<p>We remind you that President Timofti accepted the invitation of the Council of Heads of States in 2012, 2013 and 2014. Last year the high official refused for the first time to attend this event, the Republic of Moldova being represented by a delegation led by the former Prime Minister Valeriu Strelet. </p>\r\n<p>As important is to remind that at the 2014 summit held in Minsk, Nicolae Timofti had a flame war with Vladimir Putin. Timofti expressed regret about Russia's attitude towards signing the Association Agreement between Moldova and the EU and reproached Putin with placing embargoes on Moldovan products.</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p><em>\"We regret that, in the wake of the negotiations and consultations that we had, our colleagues from Russia introduced the embargo. They have not gave credible arguments on  the introduction of embargo\", </em>stated Timofti.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>In turn, Putin has expressed his regret that Moldova refused to consult with Russia on its association with the European Union.</p>\r\n<p><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/k5-SiCSkcW8\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></p>",

The former Prime-Minister appeals to Maia Sandu and advises her to put the national interest higher than her dream to become President and says that Andrei Nastase does so - only he will not give up humiliated. As an argument for Sturza's thinking is the fact that tomorrow's Civic Forum was delayed because Maia Sandu refused to attend.",
                "Continut": "<p>Sturza advises Maia Sandu to give up to \"polls and other stupid things\" and \"to unite now or to separate\", therefore urging the PAS leader to participate at the Civic Forum programmed for Thursday. </p>\r\n<p>To collaborate with the president of the Demnitate si Adevar Platform, Andrei Nastase.</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p><em>„I know that you have decided long ago to run alone at the elections... I know you think that you will accede easy in the second round of elections, and from there on, there is only half step to the desired chair. This is what Plahotniuc's polls are saying, and he is a man of the word, he promised to Miss Nuland that Moldova will have no communists and it will have a pro-European President, chosen by the people. Who if not you, fits perfectly in this American dream profile?\", states Sturza's message.</em></p>\r\n<p><em>\"Although I know that you consider that I am a guy with a shady past who smells like Panama Papers, I take the liberty of given you a public advice: you matter only if you make alliance with Andrei Nastase. Separately, the Moldovans will forget about you before Christmas\"</em>, continues the ex-Prime-Minister.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>At the same time, Sturza is warning Maia Sandu that if now she is supported by Plahotniuc's media holding, this thing could change at the moment when Andrei Nastase will step away. </p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p><em>\"If you want to change the course of history, good luck! But I am afraid that crystal balloon will be broken at the first wind blow from the holding. You need a umbrella and this umbrella can be offered by Andrei Nastase and other brave men and women\", </em>brings to attention Sturza.</p>\r\n<p><em>\"You can not do politics out of frustration, out of anger, without a team and a lot of activists. Without resources and new ideas. You took over a phenomenon, \"Maia Sandu\", that does not belong to you. As well as Nastase took over the protester phenomenon. You both have great responsibility, do not mess it up. I know that, in case of... Washington and Frankfurt is waiting you. But I don't think that you have the right to mistake. It is not a personal bet, it is ours, all of us\", </em>warns Sturza. </p>\r\n<p><em>\"I also know that Andrei is ready to give up. As strange as it seems, for him it is important to break the system, not the position itself. But he will not do it through humiliation. He's team will not do it either, for sure\", </em>mentions the ex-Prime-Minister. </p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>Finally, Ion Sturza is announcing that Maia Sandu refused to attend the Civic Forum on Thursday, motivating that she \"is busy\".  </p>\r\n<p>See the entire post:</p>\r\n<p><iframe src=\"https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fi.sturza%2Fposts%2F1296730167066238&amp;width=500\" width=\"500\" height=\"280\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" style=\"border: none; overflow: hidden;\"></iframe></p>\r\n<p>We remind you that earlier Iurie Leanca suggested that Maia Sandu and Andrei Nastase will not come to an agreement and he named, sarcastically, the single nominee \"Maia Nastase\".</p>\r\n<p>Afterwards the PAS, PLDM and PPDA leaders stated at the \"IN PROfunzime\" TV show that they do not give up the idea of a single candidate. The nominee will be chosen between Maia Sandu and Andrei Nastase based on polls from the inside that are made in September. </p>",

                "Continut": "<p>During a press conference, Silvia Radu mentioned that it is very important that the next President is independent from any political force from Moldova. </p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p><em>\"If there will be no intervention soon, with reforms and decided changes, the crisis could get worse and the consequences of it could be extremely bad. We all can see that the faith in the political class is very low. The people are disappointed by the politicians, the parties continue the war between them for interests that have nothing in common with the interests of the country... I do not think that the actual political class will change on its own. I do not see any will or interest for this thing. I do not believe either in the new parties created by old politicians... In my firm opinion the next President should be totally apolitical... We do not need a President that has a vulnerable past and can be blackmailed. The President that is elected by the people must be free when taking the position and remain free till the end of his mandate. He must not engage in any political project, to be a true mediator, not to divide the citizens by geopolitical standards or spoken language\"</em>, stated Silvia Radu.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>When asked about her geopolitical vison, Silvia Radu declared that she is not focusing on a certain vector and she wants to be the President for the entire nation.</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p><em>\"The people will decide the vector that this country will be developed. I believe in European values, I promote international standards. I am sure that the market economy that is promoted by EU available for Moldova in the case that the governmental institutions will be depoliticized and we will have technocrats that will be able to implement those reforms in our economy\"</em>, stated Silvia Radu.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>The fact that Silvia Radu could candidate for the Presidency, hinted the leader of PN, Renato Usatai, who announced yesterday in a video post on Facebook, that Silvia Radu <a href=\"/en/news/political/551/Usatii-is-calming-down-Maia-Sandu-and-makes-Iurie-Leanca-a-President.htm\">will beat to a frazzle</a> Maia Sandu. To be specified that the Mayor of Balti stated before that only partial they correspond to reality or totally were lacking reality.   </p>\r\n<p>Silvia Radu worked for Gas Natural Fenosa since 2000, but at the beginning if 2008 she became CEO of the company. </p>",

At the same time, the CEC officials are denying the fact that they discussed with another institution about Platon's arrival and submission of the necessary documents.  </p>\r\n<p><em>\"They placed a note on the prison door that because of a pretended quarantine period, the entering and exiting the institution is forbidden, although other prisoners are having a normal day, they are going to court...etc\", said Vazdoaga.</em></p>\r\n<p>\n\t\t\t<div class=\"cs_img \"  style=\"width:480px;\">\n\t\t\t <p><a href=\"/images/cms-image-000000822.jpg\" class=\"photoViewer\" title=\"\"> \t\t\t\t<img src=\"/get_img?ImageWidth=480&amp;ImageHeight=640&amp;ImageId=822\"   border=\"0\"/>\n\t\t\t </a></p> \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\n</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>When they were called for an explication, the DIP told us that they will call us back, after they will inquire on the matter.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>(UPDATE) The Attorney Ion Vazdoaga, which is at the 13<sup>th</sup> Penitentiary, told us that on the door of the institution appeared a new note: the access is forbidden until 14:00</p>\r\n<p>\n\t\t\t<div class=\"cs_img \"  style=\"width:450px;\">\n\t\t\t <p><a href=\"/images/cms-image-000000824.jpg\" class=\"photoViewer\" title=\"\"> \t\t\t\t<img src=\"/get_img?ImageRatio=75&amp;ImageWidth=450&amp;ImageHeight=600&amp;ImageId=824\"   border=\"0\"/>\n\t\t\t </a></p> \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\n</p>\r\n<p>We remind you that a similar situation happened in 2015, when Ilan Shor, while placed in house arrest, being investigated for bank frauds, enrolled in the Electoral race. More than that, he won the post of the Mayor of Orhei, and today the citizens of Orhei are protesting on his behalf.</p>\r\n<p>It is also very important to remind you the statements of the Ukrainian advocate, Gleb Saghida at the end of July, who stated that Platon is an Ukrainian citizen from the year of 2002 and that Platon give up the Moldovan and the Russian Federation citizenship due to personal reasons. <em>\"When Platon was deputy in the neighboring country, he was a victim of the oppression of the actual Government\"</em>. The defender claims that the arrest of Platon is a political order, and Ukraine is preparing to extradite a citizen that is a foreigner.   </p>\r\n<p>Veaceslav Platon was extradited in the Republic of Moldova on August 29<sup>th </sup>2016. On August 30<sup>th</sup>, the businessman was placed in custody for 30 days at the 13<sup>th</sup> Penitentiary from Chisinau.</p>\r\n<p>He is charged in two cases, money laundering and defalcation of funds in big proportions. After the searches, made at Victoriabank, Moldinconbank, Moldova Agroindbank and ASITO insurance company, the anti-corruption prosecutors found documents that could prove the connection of Platon with the theft of the billion from the banking system.</p>",

The attempt to expand the European Union in Ukraine and Moldova by the Association Agreement had an immediate reaction from Russia: the annexation of Crimea and occupation of eastern Ukraine\", declared the former President Traian Basescu at the PMP summer school for youth held at Neptun\",</em> writes News.ro.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>The former head of state said that not many Romanian or Moldovan politicians who have the courage to recognize that Russia's opposition can block Moldova's European path.</p>\r\n<p>Traian Basescu appreciated that the Transnistria's accession decree to the Russian Federation is also an adverse reaction to EU enlargement to the East.</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p><em>\"Do not think that what Shevchuk did a few days ago (Yevgeny Shevchuk, leader of the separatist region - Ed.), when he declared Transnistria a part of the Russian Federation, is not also a reaction to Moldova's Association Agreement with the EU. So, Moscow has clearly said «stop» because if the enlargement of EU and NATO does not stop, we risk war in the region\"</em>, said the president of PMP.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>He also added that an eventual union of Moldova with Romania will bring benefits to both sides. </p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p><em>„It is not a favor that Romania would do for the Republic of Moldova, however, equally, Romania would also win a lot from this union\"</em>, concluded Basescu.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>The leader of the separatist region Transnistria,  Yevgeny Shevchuk signed on Thursday a decree, which implements the results of the unrecognized referendum from September 17th, 2006, when 97 % of the region's residents voted for joining Russia. Nevertheless, the popular consultation was not recognized by any international institution. </p>\r\n<p>Such a measure would represent the first step of the separatist region to join the Russian Federation. At the same time, the decree signed by the separatist leader also provides for the law adjustment to the Russian one.</p>\r\n<p>Transnistria region proclaimed its \"independence\" from the Republic of Moldova in the 90s, following a bloody war, which has resulted in approximately 1,500 deaths. However, the separatist region is not recognized by the international community, including Moscow.</p>\r\n<p>Russia deployed troops in the area: we are talking about 1,300 soldiers, 350 of which are part of the peacekeeping troops.</p>\r\n<p>Source: <a href=\"http://www.digi24.ro/stiri/externe/moldova/basescu-r-moldova-nu-va-fi-membra-a-ue-niciodata-563551\" target=\"_blank\">Digi24</a></p>",

                "lead": "The relations between Moldova and NATO and EU - crowned by the IMF Agreement, at the staff-level agreement, and the prove that Moldova can operate efficiently towards normality - benefited by the decisive support from Romania, a consultant actor in this matter between the two big international entities, stated essentially for Realitatea TV, the Romanian Foreign Minister, Lazar Comanescu.",
                "Continut": "<p><strong>The Romanian Diplomat referred also to the decree signed by the separatist leader Yevgeny Shevchuk regarding the implementation of the goals of the 2006th<sup> </sup>referendum, when the independence of the Transnistrian region and its later joining of the Russian Federation was voted by 97% of the total participants. Reminding the opinion of the German Foreign Minister, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, who two months ago, spoke about a special status for Transnistria, the head of Romanian Diplomacy mentioned that Transnistria could have a special status, only in the conditions of keeping the territorial integrity of the Republic of Moldova. </strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>We are reproducing below, with some cuts, the fragment of the interview of the chief of the Romanian Diplomacy regarding the Republic of Moldova. </strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>— Mr. Comanescu, extremely harsh statements came from Tiraspol. Mr. Shevchuk is in a campaign, or continues the campaign started many years ago, from ten years since the referendum: Tiraspol demands forced annexation (practically, towards Ukraine) to Russian Federation. How is this thing seen at Bucharest.</strong></p>\r\n<p>—  Before joining the mission, we both saw some comments on this subject, and I want to cohere with Mr. Iulian Chifu. But I would add some things. First of all, the Republic of Moldova is an independent state, Romania was the first country to recognize Moldova as an independent country. It is a member of the United Nations, and a participant member of the OSCE. It is a member state of various international organisations, recognized as so in its integrity. Of course there is the Transnistrian issue, but for this matter, as you well know, there is a negotiation format: the well known 5+2 format, in which the participants at this negotiations are Russia, Ukraine, the Republic of Moldova, OSCE and, as observers - USA and European Union. This summer, after a two year interruption, took place a reunion in this format, where all the participants (and it is important to remember who they are, either participants or observers) pronounced themselves for continuing the efforts to find a solution to the Transnistrian problem, in the conditions of which Moldova must stay an integral state, sovereign, in its territorial integrity. This is a very important thing to mention.    </p>\r\n<p>Secondly, last week took place an informal reunion of the Foreign Ministers from the participating states of OSCE and this aspect was also very clearly pointed out. Obviously, in this period, we are spectators of all kind of positions of a person or another, to all sorts of comments, news more or less true. I think that truly the news that came up during this day concerns this context a lot, in which is circulating all kind of information, and especially, in the context in which in Transnistria will be so called Presidential Elections in December. In my opinion, essential is the fact that Moldova is an independent country. Regarding the problems Moldova is facing: they must be found starting from the need of preservation the territorial integrity, sovereignty of the Republic of Moldova. I believe this thing is very important and, I repeat, it is about the approach that is learned,  inclusively by the actors that I  referred, in the 5+2 format. This thing is very immportant.</p>\r\n<p><strong>—This statement of Mr. Shevchuk, that surely can be treated in the electoral register, being very poorly placed in the pools towards the groups from Tiraspol and its candidates, however, after almost two months from a statement of a very known Foreign Minister (and the man you know very well, as the former Romanian Ambassador to Berlin). It is about Mr. Steinmeier, who two years ago, was the first European Official to speak about a special status for Transnistria and maybe that is why there is a certain fear. What did Mr. Steinmeier want to say? </strong></p>\r\n<p>—The things should be considered thoughtfully. The discussions that are carried out are those of finding a formula of understanding between Chisinau and Tiraspol. Therefore, a solution that will mean offering some opportunities, some answers to a few specific requests. In the context however, I repeat, of keeping the territorial integrity of the Republic of Moldova. I would also add something (and such edicts as the one we are talking about might be linked as well to the next thing): do you know that between the Republic of Moldova and European Union exists an association agreement and free trade. After coming into force this agreement, which enforces throughout the Republic of Moldova, is found that in the business community from Transnistria exists a growing interest and an increasing perception over the opportunities that has such an agreement for this business community. In addition, this things may also play a certain role. However, I repeat, we are in a context that the Republic of Moldova is an independent country. The main actors - who are trying to find a solution to the Transnistrian problem, including Russian Federation, including Ukraine - have this approach: solving the Transnistrian problem in the context of keeping territorial integrity of the Republic of Moldova. While Romania, as you well know, as I was saying, was the first country that acknowledged the independence of the Republic of Moldova, is recognized at present as an important actor, which is consulted regarding the way how to evolve the relations between European Union, the Euro-Atlantic community and the Republic of Moldova. I tell you as one who is involved directly in these intercessions. We are consulted and this says a lot. You also saw the agreement that has been reached at the<em> </em><em>staff-level agreement</em>, with the Monetary Fund - due to, on one hand, the fulfilling of certain conditions that assumed the government of the Republic of Moldova, on the other hand, the cooperation with us, with the Monetary Fund, with the institutions from Brussels, with the partners from the European Union and the Euro-Atlantic ones. As such, they all admitted that Moldova made important steps hereinafter, despite some question marks from the end of the last year, beginning of the current year. Here it is, Moldova was able to prove that can act and is operating.</p>\r\n<p><strong>— You have made a <strong>very interesting </strong>recommendation to the ambassadors, although I do not know if you referred only to our ambassadors or you referred to all the ambassadors, about knowing the history: how important it is for an ambassador to know the history of the country where he is located. My question is very direct and I hope that your answer to be as direct<strong> and elaborate</strong> as possible: <strong>US </strong>Ambassador Pettit, to Chisinau, knows the Moldovan history? </strong></p>\r\n<p>— I think that you referred to a statement that I made at a joint press conference with the Secretary General of NATO; was the very day that was found out about ... I do not know if someone or someone else knows or does not know enough history. What I can tell you is this: I think there is room for all of us to know much deeper the history. Because history teaches us, firstly, to understand the world as evolving over time, to understand where are sensitive issues, which may have a stimulating role, however can also generate question marks. And so it is good to know the history and sensitivities ... We have many examples in Europe about such sensitivities, but also in Europe we have enough examples of the ability to overcome particularly strong sensitivities, when the thing that animates us is to go ahead together. From this perspective, I want to say one thing. Regarding the support of efforts to bring Moldova closer to full membership - hopefully - in EU, integration and democratic transformation, we have benefited and we benefit from a very close cooperation, including - and especially - the United States of America. In addition, in May, when I was with the Prime Minister to Washington, I would like to remind that we signed with the management of USAID, a Memorandum of Understanding on development assistance, with the main target, to work together, Romania and the United States of America, for the support programs in the Republic of Moldova. This is the position of the United States. And I think the US Embassy press release from Bucharest immediately published ...</p>\r\n<p><strong>— It was something else. The US Embassy in Bucharest has proved as something else towards the US Embassy in Chisinau. </strong></p>\r\n<p>— Good. And with this I return to the idea:  thorough knowing and understanding of the history are, both, extremely important for any diplomat. </p>",

Even if he announced before about his intention to submit the documents as a candidate at the Presidential Elections, Nastase accused the Central Electoral Commission of violating its own regulations, reproaching the fact that CEC allowed the receiving of the documents of the PD nominee in their off days.  </p>\r\n<p>We state precisely that until now, three candidates - from those 24 that submitted their initiative groups for collecting the signatures - filled already the documents for registration as an electoral candidate. They are: Marian Lupu, Mihai Ghimpu and Iurie Leanca.</p>",

                "lead": "If a referendum would be held on the Unification of the Republic of Moldova with Romania, Maia Sandu would vote for it. However, according to the president of the Action and Solidarity Party, this is only the position of the citizen Maia Sandu and not of the party. The Party position is that we promise to do what is real to do today. Regarding the scandal after the statement of the US Ambassador, James D. Pettit, on that point, according to the PAS leader, maybe only \"the part with history was a little not too properly expressed\", writes realitatea.md.",
                "Continut": "<blockquote>\r\n<p><em>\"I think Mr. Ambassador knows that a good part of the population is sharing this aspiration and I think he did not want to offense anyone. Maybe the part with history was a little not too properly expressed, as for the rest I believe that he wanted to say that the Republic of Moldova has interior problems, referring to Transnistria, regarding the presence of the minorities and these things and the lack of dialogue is not easy to solve. I was not surprised by this statement of his because in the community of the donors or in the community of the Ambassadors I have heard many times such declarations\",</em> said Maia Sandu in the TV show \"Pahomi\" at Realitatea TV.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>The PAS leader holds that whilst personally would vote for the union, the formation she represents \"promises what it can do\". <em>\"The Union may happen when the majority of the citizens of this country will support this desire. At the moment, there is no majority, that is why we are realists and say what we can do\"</em>, said Maia Sandu, mentioning meanwhile that <em>\"there is place for a serious debate on the union problem\"</em>.</p>\r\n<p>Asked to answer if she has or does not have trust in her political partner-Andrei Nastase, the Pas leader backed out, mentioning that \"the trust is built\" and \"must be referred to certain actions\". Nevertheless, the former Minister of Education admits that one of them might withdraw from the electoral race in favor of the over. </p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p><em>\"The trust is built, it does not fall from the top. This exercise we are in is a chance to build this confidence and if we both respect our commitment, then this trust will be built. We need certain proofs to be able to build this trust\", </em>tried Maia Sandu to answer the question.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>Previously, during an interview offered to the public TV station, Moldova 1, the US Ambassador to Chisinau, James D. Pettit stated that \"Moldova is not Romania, Moldova has its own history and its own challenges\". This has sparked a wave of criticism from the union supporters, some of whom have even started an online petition that called for the expulsion of the US diplomat from our country.</p>",

This thing means actually, the reborn of the \"Kozak Plan\", which Russia supported always and which was buried by President Voronin\", stated Paholkov. </p>\r\n<p>Now, claims the deputy, Russia practically does not work at the realization of the \"Kozak Plan\", because does not see a partner in the Republic of Moldova on this matter.  </p>\r\n<p>We mention that according to Shevchuk's decree, who asked that the Transnistrian legislation to be adjusted to the one in the Russian Federation, starting with the so called referendum in September 2006, September 17th is declared a holiday and named \"Together with Russia\", and the Transnistrians are called to watch Russian movies on this day and to have fun at the concerts. </p>\r\n<p>According to the referendum's data from 2006, unacknowledged at the international level, almost 97% from the participants at the referendum have voted for the annexation to the Russian Federation.  </p>",

                "lead": "In an exclusive interview with the Atlantic Council Deputy Director Ashish Kumar Sen, Moldovan Prime Minister Pavel Filip expressed the hope that the country’s next president will share his commitment to European integration.",
                "Continut": "<p>Moldovan Prime Minister Pavel Filip said his government is committed to European integration and expressed the hope that the country’s next president will share that same commitment.<br /><br />Moldova will hold its first direct presidential elections on October 30. Like in past elections, this one has split voters between pro-Europe and pro-Russia candidates.<br /><br />“I hope that the next president will fully understand the need for keeping Moldova’s EU ascension on a smooth and stable path,” said Filip.<br /><br />Moldova has paid a heavy price for its pro-Europe tilt. In 2014, Russia banned the import of Moldovan agricultural products after the government in Chișinău moved to deepen political and economic ties with the European Union. <br /><br />In February, the European Council <a href=\"http://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2016/02/15-fac-moldova-conclusions/\" target=\"_blank\">reaffirmed its commitment</a> to “strengthening the political association and economic integration” between the EU and Moldova. It also confirmed that all twenty-eight member states had ratified the Association Agreement.<br /><br />Moldova also faces security challenges from Russia. In 1990, Russian-backed separatists in Transnistria, a strip of territory in eastern Moldova, declared independence. While it is not internationally recognized, Transnistria is locked in a frozen conflict and Russian troops frequently conduct exercises in the territory. Moscow uses so-called gray zones—like Transnistria, Abkhazia, South Ossetia, and Crimea—to put pressure on and destabilize its neighborhood.<br /><br />Moldova, Europe’s poorest country, was <a href=\"http://www.economist.com/news/finance-and-economics/21660165-banking-scandal-set-bankrupt-europes-poorest-country-gutted\" target=\"_blank\">rocked</a> by a political crisis in January of 2015 after $1 billion was found to be missing from Moldovan banks. The scandal led to the arrest of Vlad Filat, a former prime minister; deterred the International Monetary Fund (IMF) from negotiating a new loan program with Moldova; and unleashed a backlash against Moldova’s ruling elite. [The IMF has since reached a <a href=\"https://www.imf.org/en/News/Articles/2016/07/26/20/57/PR16365-Moldova-IMF-Staff-and-the-Moldovan-Authorities-Reached-a-Staff-Level-Agreement\" target=\"_blank\">staff-level agreement</a> with Moldova for a $179 million, three-year loan agreement conditional on the government carrying out reforms. The deal must be approved by the IMF’s board in October.]<br /><br />In January of 2016, Filip was appointed prime minister after the previous government was ousted in a no-confidence vote. He is Moldova’s fifth prime minister since 2009. Filip’s appointment triggered <a href=\"http://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-moldova-politics-idUKKCN0UZ1OI\" target=\"_blank\">massive protests</a> because of his ties to Vladimir Plahotniuc, a prominent oligarch and deputy chairman of the ruling Democratic Party of Moldova. The prime minister <a href=\"http://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-35403563\" target=\"_blank\">refused to step down</a>.<br /><br />Filip, who described Plahotniuc as “a force for good for Moldova,” said: “The truth is we inherited a broken car, without brakes, that was going downhill.”<br /><br />“In the eight months since taking office, we repaired the car and put it back on the path toward Europe. We are now reliable economically and politically,” he added.<br /><strong></strong><br /><strong>Pavel Filip</strong> commented on a wide range of topics in an e-mail interview with the <em>New Atlanticist’s</em> <strong>Ashish Kumar Sen</strong>. Here are excerpts from our interview.<br /><strong></strong><br /><strong><em>In 2014, around $1 billion was embezzled from three major Moldovan banks. What is your government doing to address the problem of rampant corruption and improve transparency in Moldova?</em></strong><em></em><br /><br /><strong>Filip:</strong> The banking scandal caused one of the biggest economic, political, and social crises our country has ever faced. It was an indefensible tragedy that shook our country’s faith in its government and the authorities responsible for safeguarding the banking system and judiciary. Our government is determined to clean up the country and restore trust through confidence-building measures, particularly banking sector and judicial reforms, and put Moldova back on the path toward progress. <br /><br />I have always been a reformer, first demonstrated when I was IT minister when I brought a fresh, private sector perspective to government. As prime minister, together with my cabinet ministers, we initiated reforms from day one—and we are fortunate to have a very good partner in the parliamentary majority. <br /><br />After passing strong anti-corruption and judicial reform legislation, we are now focused on implementation. There are high expectations for the new National Anticorruption Center, and we are already seeing results: prosecutors have launched a comprehensive inquiry to identify the guilty parties in the bank fraud case, and we were able to recover part of the stolen assets. At the same time, we are cutting red tape, working closely with the private sector via the Prime Minister's Economic Council, to build transparency and restore the trust of the Moldovan people. <br /><br />The truth is we inherited a broken car, without brakes, that was going downhill. In the eight months since taking office, we repaired the car and put it back on the path toward Europe. We are now reliable economically and politically. Challenges remain. While there are detractors— who attack our progress without offering any constructive policy alternatives—our government is determined to clean up the country. We have put aside political vanity, rolled up our sleeves, and started working; we appreciate the responsibility on our shoulders to put Moldova back on track with regard to the economy, EU integration, and international credibility.<br /><strong><em></em></strong></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>Besides corruption, the power wielded by the oligarchs is a significant problem that is often cited as one reason for the growing popularity of the pro-Russia camp in Moldova. What steps are you taking to curb the influence of oligarchs, in general, and Vladimir Plahotniuc of your own Democratic Party of Moldova, in particular?</em></strong><br /><em></em><br /><strong>Filip:</strong> For as much progress as our government has made in a short time, Moldova is still a country in transition. The presence of “oligarchs” and tycoons is something we deal with and are moving away from as our country firmly finds its footing in Europe and the West. We must be a nation committed to the rule of law. If there is illegal activity, it must be ferreted out and the guilty parties must be held accountable. As prime minister, I stand by this as I know that our country has a real chance for independence and sovereignty if its leadership is courageous. <br /><br />In truth, Vladimir Plahotniuc is a force for good for Moldova. He is committed to his country, prosperity, and progress; he seeks consensus on reforms through his role in the Democratic Party of Moldova (PDM). Business leaders, like Plahotniuc, are helping Moldova build a vibrant and modern private sector, creating jobs, encouraging investment, and developing new industries. <br /><br />In the new Moldova, every player sticks to his role. While it is normal to coordinate within the PDM on reforms, I lead government action in partnership with colleagues such as speaker of the parliament, Andrian Candu. Our country needs reforms, and the truth is the political class kept avoiding them and simply fought internally. For once, we have a team in power that prefers working over talking. Of course, this type of proactive, constructive way of governing is not welcomed by our political opponents, who prefer to fuel disruption and conspiracy theories instead of helping the country and its citizens. However, you can’t pay salaries and pensions by just wining, dining, and conspiring. The opposition needs to understand that attacking our leaders and demonizing our actions will not help the country.<br /><strong></strong><br /><strong><em>What is your government doing to ensure that the presidential election in October is free and fair?</em></strong><br /><em></em><br /><strong>Filip:</strong> This democratic exercise has huge significance—this will be the first direct presidential election, the result of civil society and public demands, which were approved by a Constitutional Court decision. There is a lot of hope surrounding the election, from our citizens as well as the international community. I want to make sure that this election is as fair, as democratic, and as transparent as it can possibly be. We will have domestic and foreign observers, and the relevant electoral authorities will be ready to investigate any and all complaints that anyone may have about any part of the process. We sent this signal to all citizens as well as international stakeholders. We hope that the opposition supports the process in a constructive and professional way and we invite them to participate. <br /><strong></strong><br /><strong><em>Why is this an important election for the West and for Moldova’s European aspirations, and why is it important for Moldova to be pro-European?</em></strong><br /><em></em><br /><strong>Filip:</strong> Moldova hasn’t reached its full potential in terms of democratic consolidation, economic stability, and international aspirations, partly because of our domestic problems and partly because of foreign influences that have not always worked in our favor. We need to stay on course, but that requires popular support.<br /><br />This government is working hard to present our EU integration to the people as it is: a consistent, efficient process that will help us achieve stability and prosperity within the European family. I hope that the next president will fully understand the need for keeping Moldova’s EU ascension on a smooth and stable path. This government, in place until 2018, will remain strongly pro-European. I’m hoping for good teamwork; we must keep Moldova’s best interests at the center of our hearts and minds.<br /><br />When thinking about why it is important for Moldova to be pro-European, the example of Romania comes instantly to mind. Our good neighbor and constant friend is the best example of what the EU brings in terms of increased stability, economic opportunity, and the fight against corruption.<br /><strong><em></em></strong></p>\r\n<p><strong><em>What is Russia’s impact—from troops in Transnistria to media propaganda—in Moldova, and what is your government doing to address this challenge?</em></strong><br /><em></em><br /><strong>Filip:</strong> Regarding the issue of propaganda, we are now working to pass a new audio-visual code that would limit its impact. For Moldova to continue to grow, it is important for our citizens to have access to native content that is free from outside influence. I would also stress the need for civic education, and I look forward to working within civil society to improve this. <br /><br />As for the Transnistria issue, we are working closely with our international partners to find a workable solution. Important steps were made on environmental protection and the recognition of local university diplomas, and we are confident we can do more. At the same time, it's election season in Tiraspol and Moscow as well, so we prefer a deliberate approach to Transnistria rather than an emotional one.<br /><strong></strong><br /><strong><em>Are you concerned that Moscow will stir up trouble in Gagauzia?</em></strong><br /><em></em><br /><strong>Filip:</strong> Gagauzia is part of Moldova’s territory. We respect their autonomy and are sure there is a recipe for mutual success—namely through more investment and more development funding on our way to EU reforms. Improving welfare, creating employment, and encouraging higher standards of living mitigate many problems. <br /><strong></strong><br /><strong><em>What impact have Russian sanctions had on Moldova?</em></strong><br /><em></em><br /><strong>Filip: </strong>In the short term, our farmers had to look elsewhere—we were forced to diversify and find new export markets. Romania gave a helping hand, and the EU opened its market for us; we are incredibly grateful for that. So, in fact, we were able to use this as an opportunity for growth, increasing the visibility of our goods and gaining access to more Western markets. A lot of people love our bio products, and our exports will continue to grow. However, business is business—it should not become personal. Russia remains an important market for us and we want to work constructively with them. We hope that Moscow understands that Moldova’s products are still traditional and unique, and in an industrialized world, this is harder to find. <br /><br />At the end of the day, we remain open for business with Russia, just as we are open for business with the West. We have no intention to be hostile. Instead, we look forward to developing a pragmatic partnership with Moscow based on business and mutual geopolitical respect.<br /><strong></strong><br /><strong><em>At the same time, Moldova is deeply dependent on Russia for its energy needs. What is Moldova doing to reduce this dependence?</em></strong><em></em><br /><br /><strong>Filip:</strong> This dependency is a post-Soviet relic, and we are trying to diversify our energy suppliers and sources by working with our neighbors, particularly Romania. Moldova needs to focus on concrete projects like the Iasi-Ungheni pipeline and improving our energy efficiency. I hope that a decade from now, Moldova becomes not only more energy independent, but also a key regional player in the energy sector.</p>\r\n<p>Source: <a href=\"http://www.atlanticcouncil.org/blogs/new-atlanticist/moldova-s-prime-minister-committed-to-a-pro-europe-path\" target=\"_blank\">Atlantic Council</a></p>",

                "lead": "Western attention has been fixed on Ukraine as the field of Vladimir Putin's aggression in Europe. But now the Kremlin is turning its attention to small, impoverished Moldova, where Moscow controls a breakaway territory called Transnistria. It bears attention lest another Russian power play come to pass.",
                "Continut": "<p>This week is the 10th anniversary of a bogus referendum held by the territory’s pro-Kremlin regime, in which 97.2% of residents demanded to be annexed by Russia. To mark the occasion, Transnistria's \"president,\" Yevgeny Shevchuk - even Moscow doesn’t formally recognize his state - has issued a decree asking for full annexation. He also announced the formation of a committee to harmonize Transnistrian law with Russian law, and demanded a harmonization plan by November.</p>\r\n<p>Transnistria is a sliver of land on the eastern side of the river Dniester, hence the name. The territory belongs to Moldova, but it emerged as a pro-Russian statelet soon after Moldova declared sovereignty in 1990 amid the Soviet Union’s collapse. Moldova’s campaign two years later to retake the territory resulted in a stalemate after Russia’s intervention.</p>\r\n<p>Mr. Putin so far has kept mum on the decree, though it's unlikely Mr. Shevchuk would issue it without Kremlin approval. Russian media are enthusiastic about the annexation idea. So are the Kremlin-linked ideologues who believe that any part of Europe with pockets of Russian speakers properly belongs to the motherland. Roughly a third of Transnistria's 500,000 residents are ethnic Russian.</p>\r\n<p>Moscow accuses Moldova and neighboring Ukraine of \"squeezing\" the territory. There is no love lost between Ukraine and pro-Russian separatists in Transnistria, but the Kiev government denies a systematic blockade other than the suspension of military cooperation that followed Moscow's illegal annexation of Crimea and aggression in eastern Ukraine.</p>\r\n<div class=\"unruly wsj-body-ad\">\r\n<div id=\"wsj-body-AD_G3\" class=\"wsj-responsive-ad-wrap wsj-ad-article-body\" data-ad-options=\"{\" data-tracking=\"facebook.wsj.com/opinion_reviewout_story\" data-google-query-id=\"CPvexcPrkM8CFcVuGwodpQcLyg\">\r\n<div id=\"google_ads_iframe_/2/facebook.wsj.com/opinion_reviewout_story_4__container__\">As the political theater surrounding the annexation decree has escalated, Mr. Putin has been flexing his military muscles in Transnistria. In August Moscow held a tank drill in the territory, and about 400 Russian troops participated in a drill there in April 2015. They're part of a contingent of about 1,000 troops Moscow maintains in the territory, breaking earlier promises to remove them by 2002.</div>\r\n</div>\r\n</div>\r\n<p>The exercises and Mr. Shevchuk's annexation decree suggest Mr. Putin is testing the climate in the West for a potential next move. Which is why the U.S. and European leaders must telegraph that any effort to make permanent Russia’s occupation of Transnistria will be treated as an illegal encroachment on Moldovan sovereignty and trigger sanctions.</p>\r\n<p>Source: <a href=\"http://www.wsj.com/articles/putins-next-target-1473807668\" target=\"_blank\">Wall Street Journal</a></p>",

He states that Israelians wanted from him the permission to use the lands, which belong to the city halls of PN, in order to cultivate medicinal cannabis on them.

They told me that want to grow some plants in the Republic of Moldova. They asked me if we have lands in the city halls where the mayors are from \"Our Party\". They said that the investment in one hectare would bring revenue of millions. They also said that in the Republic of Moldova is allowed the cultivation of these plants. I understood that this was about medicinal cannabis. I told them that I never heard of this, however if all the judicial issues are solved, then all the Moldova would agree to cultivate these plants. Afterwards they disappeared and now I see on TV that they were arrested. I do not know what these people are doing, however I have said that everything that is legal should be done because the country is on its knees and only with tomatoes and corn we will not go far.\"</em></p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>\"Hacico said they documented on the legal aspects\", continued Renato Usatîi.</p>\r\n<p>About the fact that the fearless activist, participant at the #NuMaTem manifestation, wet himself when he was arrested, Usatii says that this is normal if we take into consideration the behavior of the institutions controlled by Vlad Plahotniuc. </p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p>\"The fact that they scared the teenager, I want to say that Plahotniuc is a bastard that uses blackmail and psychological pressure. They must be ashamed about what they did to Hacico. I have been told that the Prosecutor Bacalam proposed a deal to Hacico. To testify against Usatai, as he would be the organizer of this criminal group, in exchange for his freedom.\"</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>At the same time, Renato Usatai expressed his regret that <em>\"the editorial office Deschide.MD, which earlier was realizing journalistic investigations and was fighting with dirty cops, now is saying what is recommending to them Vlad Plahotniuc.\"</em></p>\r\n<p><strong>Editorial note: </strong>Deschide.MD is expressing its regret for the fact that Mr. Renato Usatai is not answering to our calls and texts when we are asking for his opinion and prefers to launch post-factum accusations. At the same time we assure the leader of “Our Party” that Deschide.MD continues the fight against the commited illegalities both in the institutions controlled by the actual Government, and in the rounds of the opposition Parties. Secondly, we urge Renato Usatai to send to our editorial office information about any illegalities whenever he will have any, and we will investigate them with maximum responsibility, as we did it always with the topics sent to us by our loyal readers.</p>\r\n<p>We will remind you that yesterday, the General Inspectorate of Police announced in a press release about the arresting of a man that was a member of a criminal group, uncovered by the Police in July 2016. After the investigations, made by the reporters of Deschide.MD, we found out that this is about Nicolae Hacico, member of “Our Party”, the 29<sup>th </sup> nominee on the list of the “Patria” Party at the Parliamentary elections in 2014. At his 32 years old, Hacico – who’s name is associated with the protest #NuMaTem – wet himself fearing off the masked police officers and handcuffs, as is seen in the unedited video obtained by the editorial office Deschide.MD </p>\r\n<p><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/djvSMqDBqms\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></p>",

Anti-feminism accusations and others followed up. </p>\r\n<p>The straining of relations between Sandu and Nastase culminated after the post of the former employee of BS - Sergiu Sagaidac - known as a eager supporter of the DA Platform, in which he criticized harsh the leader of PAS for her staying in the electoral race.    </p>\r\n<p><iframe src=\"https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fsergiu.sagaidac%2Fposts%2F984466864996697&amp;width=500\" width=\"500\" height=\"562\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" style=\"border: none; overflow: hidden;\"></iframe></p>\r\n<p>Source: <a href=\"http://www.europalibera.org/a/28002830.html\" target=\"_blank\">Radio Free Europe / Radio Liberty</a></p>",

We wish that this state would be safe, prosperous and democratic. We have plenty of patience, but it is not infinite. I, on the behalf of the Agency that I represent, must return in the Congress and explain that the money that are spent here have a positive impact and that they were spent in good faith. Our support for Moldova will increase this year, that is why we will observe more carefully the way how these financial sources will be used. In addition, you should remember that we do not offer just like that money for the Moldovan Government. The money that we provide through our programs are used for expertise, for specialists that are offering consultancy and information that could be taken into consideration by those who decide\"</em>, said Melia. </p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>The diplomat added that the American Congress will offer more financial support for countries from this region, including Ukraine and Moldova. </p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p><em>\"So, we are talking about a budget that will reach the amount of 40 million dollars for the next years. Practically, we will double the amount of money. They are only for the Republic of Moldova. They will be spend for expertise, ideas, information, in this way the authorities could make the best decisions for the good of the country\"</em>.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>At the and, Thomas Melia added that both the civil society, as well as the journalists have a very important role in Moldova - to put pressure on the deputies in some situations, but also to identify the issues and to propose solutions.  </p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p><em><br /></em></p>\r\n</blockquote>",

That is why we must to go all the way through. If it will be needed, we will fight and with so called friends.

In return, Maia Sandu accused him of anti-feminism. </p>\r\n<p>On the August 8<sup>th</sup>, PLDM, PAS and PPDA signed a mutual statement in which they took the commitment to go together with a mutual in the presidential race. The nominee was to be selected from two choices: Andrei Natase and Maia Sandu.</p>\r\n<p>Afterwards, the political analyst Oazu Nantoi, came with a public urge that both the possible candidates to sit at the round table, suggesting the fact that neither will yield in the other's favor.  </p>\r\n<p>After a few days, the ex-Prime-Minister Ion Sturza addressed a message to Maia Sandu, through which he urged her to to draw back from the electoral race.  </p>\r\n<p>After Sturza's statement, the TV post close to PPDA promoted multiple analysts, who attacked Sandu, creating a sense in the public space that Maia Sandu is stubborn and she does not want to withdraw from the race. </p>\r\n<p>At some point, the PAS leader refused to debate with Nastase at the TV post Jurnal TV, invoking that this is not a equidistant TV post.

The statement was made after the President of PLDM, Viorel Ciubotaru, stated that his voters prefer Maia Sandu as a mutual candidate for the Presidential campaign.  </p>\r\n<p>Viorel Ciubotaru stated for the Brussels journalists of the Radio Free Europe / Radio Liberty that \"the most of the PLDM voters are supporting Maia Sandu\", that is why he will propose to the National Political Council of PLDM to make a decision on this matter. </p>\r\n<p>Afterwards, Andrei Nastase stated that he would take the burden of the electoral campaign on his shoulders for the post of the President of the Republic of Moldova, ranging himself as \"a gentleman\". In return, Maia Sandu accused him of anti-feminism.   </p>\r\n<p>On the August 8<sup>th</sup>, PLDM, PAS and PPDA signed a mutual statement in which they took the commitment to go together with a mutual in the presidential race. The nominee was to be selected from two choices: Andrei Natase and Maia Sandu.</p>",

                "Continut": "<p>After signing the agreement the two officials gave press statements where they focused on the cooperation between Moldova and the European Union, the implementation of the Road Map by the authorities in Chisinau and the way to use of European funds and the public money of Moldova .</p>\r\n<p>Pavel Filip mentioned that <em>\"for the government that he leads, the signing of this agreement means a recognition of regaining the normal path of reforms and European direction of the Republic of Moldova.\"</em></p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p><em>„We advanced on the relations with IMF and the Road Map, and in the following period we are planning the practical implementation of the adopted laws. I mean here, combating corruption and the investigation of the bank fraud, the change of the audiovisual code and, also, the supervision of the financial-banking system,\" </em>said the Prime-Minister. </p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>Filip added that the public administration reform is very important in order to continue the implementation of the association agreement, and the <em>\"granted assistance will be valued with maximum transparency and will be managed as good as possible.\" </em></p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p><em>„One of the project that is going to be implemented is a system of transparentization of the public money spending. I have also spoken to Prime Minister Ciolos to see how can they help us on this matter,\" </em>stated Pavel Filip within this context.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>In turn, the European Commissioner declared that the development partners welcome the political stability that follows the political crisis from Chisinau that lasted more than a year. </p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p><em>„If there is a focus on the delivery, but all of the authorities, the country can make a significant jump forward. This support will contribute to the micro-financial stability</em>\", stated Hahn by mentioning that the commitment to the Road Map is important, but also its implementation in the following period not only its fulfillment.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>The Official was asked by the journalists and what is his opinion regarding the report of the European Court of Auditors, about which he stated that, in his opinion, should focus on a concrete project.</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p><em>„Well, I think one has to reflect about the nature of this support. This was budgetary support. I am not a great supporter of a general budgetary support be it in Moldova, be it in other countries. I am more in favor of very concrete projects where we can define the beginning and the end of something and this will immediately improve the quality, the transparency of the use of money, also the European money, if it's more project oriented. My conclusions out of this report which is, by the way, in substance confronting my general concerns about budgetary support is to change the character how we deploy money to countries where we would like to see particular developments in certain areas,\" </em>stated Hahn and added that the unfulfillment of certain conditions was caused by the political instability. </p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p><iframe src=\"http://www.privesc.eu/widget/live/69047\" width=\"758\" height=\"370\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>",

Hahn came with an appeal in this sense to all the candidates at the Presidential campaign, to all the political parties and to media to avoid the deformation campaign.</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p><em>“I would like also to all the candidates, parties, media to avoid deformation campaigns, which would not improve Moldova’s image, and by the way, one should always keep in mind that after the election day, usually this should be the beginning of sound and serious cooperation between all the partners, and if there have been, so to say personal attacks, sometimes “below the belt” – this is not very helpful for future kind of cooperation…”, mentioned </em>Johannes Hahn.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>The Official also appealed to the youngsters from Moldova to participate at the Presidential elections.</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p><em>“… and the last to the citizens, the young citizens of Moldova – Participate in the elections, use your opportunities to vote, every vote counts. If you are not going to the voting cabins – others will do it for you and you are losing, so to say, your influence. In that respect, I can really urge all of you, all citizens, in particularly the younger’s – use this opportunity, it’s something the country haven’t have in the past, I mean 20-25 years ago… so don’t miss this opportunity to shape, to participate in the shaping of yours country future”, stated Hahn.</em></p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p><em>We remind you that after a 20 year break, on October 30<sup>th</sup> </em>will take place direct Presidential elections in the Republic of Moldova, as a result of the decision of the Constitutional Court from 4<sup>th</sup> of March.</p>",

                "lead": "Two years ago, nearly $1 billion disappeared from Moldova’s banks in a mysterious financial scheme that sparked a political crisis that’s still burning today. The missing money amounts to roughly 12 percent of the GDP of Moldova and the fallout from the scandal could tilt the country back towards Moscow.",
                "Continut": "<p>Since the scandal was made public in May 2015, the impact has been severe for Moldova’s Western-aligned politicians: massive protests in the streets of the capital Chisinau, five short-lived prime ministers, and sorely needed financial aid from the European Union and International Monetary Fund hanging in the balance.</p>\r\n<p>But the greatest damage from the high-profile theft could come on October 30, when Moldova — a tiny former Soviet country of 3.5 million sandwiched between Romania and Ukraine — votes in its presidential elections. The banking scandal has been a political gift for the pro-Russian Socialist Party, whose leader Igor Dodon has attracted more and more voters disappointed by Moldova’s pro-European forces and now has a good chance of winning the decisive vote this fall.</p>\r\n<p>For Andrei Galbur, Moldova’s foreign minister who is also tasked with overseeing the country’s continued integration into the EU, convincing the disillusioned and geopolitically divided electorate to maintain its Westward path is his top priority. In an interview with Foreign Policy last week, Galbur said that his government needs to do a better job of selling the merits of deeper EU ties to voters. And he said that progress on prosecuting those behind the massive financial fraud is the only option for the country’s beleaguered judiciary to restore the public’s trust in Moldova’s westward-looking political movement.</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p><em>\"Previous governments have worn out the slogan of European integration,\"</em> said Galbur. \"<em>The fact that the banner of the EU was used to conduct shady financial deals was extremely damaging. When we took over, it was politically dangerous to even mention that we were pro-European.\"</em></p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>Rifts between the pro-Russia and pro-EU camps have only grown deeper since Galbur became foreign minister in January of this year under Prime Minister Pavel Filip’s government. Western investigators hired to look into the fraud traced it back to a money-laundering scheme in Moscow involving criminal elements and oligarchs with Kremlin connections. The only major arrest in the case has been pro-Western former prime minister Vladimir Filat, who was arrested in parliament in October 2015. He was later sentenced to nine years in prison for stealing nearly $300 million, but Filat maintains the charges against him are political in nature.</p>\r\n<p>Despite the high-profile conviction, the damage from the scandal has only spread further. Brussels blocked the flow of EU aid money and the IMF has resisted offering new loans due to funds from both organizations disappearing in the bank fraud. Negotiations are currently underway to restore the flow of aid to Moldova, Europe’s poorest country, but an agreement has yet to be finalized. Moreover, the appointment of Filip, who has connections to influential oligarch and politician Vladimir Plahotniuc, has so far failed to win over the public’s trust and fueled anti-corruption protests in Chisinau this winter.</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p><em>\"We have to be more proactive in explaining the benefits of European integration,\"</em> said Galbur. <em>\"The fraud itself, while extremely negative, did have a positive side in forcing us to show our people and Western partners that we are trying to tackle this.\"</em></p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>So far, those attempts have failed to persuade the electorate. The optimism felt in the country after Moldova signed an Association Agreement with the EU and gained visa-free travel to the bloc in 2014 has waned. An April 2015 poll by the Institute for Public Policy, a nonpartisan Moldovan research center, found that 50 percent of voters preferred joining the Russian-led Eurasian Union compared to the EU. In the lead-up the presidential elections, Dodon, the Socialists’ leader, is the early favorite as the voting list is finalized.</p>\r\n<p>If elected, Dodon would be the country’s first president since 2009 who is not in favor of closer ties with Europe. Despite not being part of the ruling coalition, the Socialist Party holds the most seats in parliament and a potential Dodon presidency would move Moldova decisively closer to Moscow.</p>\r\n<p>Russia already plays a significant role in Moldova because of the pro-Russian breakaway region of Transnistria, which declared independence in 1990 and was the subject of a military conflict in 1992. Russian troops have been stationed in Transnistria ever since and recently conducted military exercises on the narrow strip of territory in August.</p>\r\n<p>Relations with the Kremlin loom large over Moldovan politics. In addition to Transnistria, Russia is Moldova’s largest energy supplier and a major export market — two points of leverage Moscow has sought to exploit as Chisinau has moved West. Russia banned the import of Moldovan wine in 2013 on sanitation grounds, but the move was widely seen as retaliation for the pro-Western government moving closer to the EU. The wine ban was followed by another round of economically damaging moves by Russia in 2014, when Moscow retaliated against Western sanctions levied due to its annexation of Crimea with measures of its own against EU food products. Agriculture-dependent Moldova, which had just joined the European collective market, was among the hardest hit.</p>\r\n<p>In his time as foreign minister, Galbur has aimed to salvage relations with Moscow without sacrificing closer ties with Europe. Based on the several meetings he’s had with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov since January, Galbur says that he remains cautiously optimistic on a settlement with Transnistria and easing the economic impact of Russian bans. The Moldovan diplomat, however, is quick to note that progress will be slow.</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p><em>\"We want to engage with Russia and be constructive and pragmatic, but we’re not naive,\"</em> said Galbur. <em>\"It’s important for Moscow to know that we aren’t going to flirt with them, we won’t give something away to establish good relations again.\"</em></p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>But diplomacy may have little impact in swaying voters ahead of the election in October. While Dodon appears to have channeled the country’s discontent so far, a series of pro-Western politicians with strong credentials on reform are likely to contend with the socialist. Lawyer and activist Andrei Nastase has built a reputation railing against the country’s judiciary and Maya Sandu, a Harvard-educated economist and former education minister, has formed her own political party and garnered support around her message of curbing state corruption and the influence of oligarchs in politics.</p>\r\n<p>An April poll from the International Republican Institute found that 83 percent of the country thinks Moldova is moving in the wrong direction, with concerns over a lack of reforms and corruption topping the list of concerns.</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p><em>\"It is our responsibility to be able to communicate with our own people,\"</em> said Galbur. <em>\"This is a country project, which will take a significant amount of time.\"</em></p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>Source: <a href=\"http://foreignpolicy.com/2016/09/26/moscow-looks-to-gain-in-moldovas-election-amid-anger-over-corruption/\" target=\"_blank\">Foreign Policy</a></p>",

                "lead": "During a interview offered to the portal TRIBUNA, the First Vice President of PDM, Vlad Plahotniuc spoke about elections, Veaceslav Platon’s accusations, arrest of the judges and other actual topics.",
                "Continut": "<p><strong>T:</strong> <strong>PDM entered very vigorous in pre-campaign, you have a very good visual campaign. It is vital to win the Presidential elections?  </strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>V.P.:</strong> PDM is one of the most important parties from Moldova, it is the Party with the best display in the field, so it is normal that we mobilize in the electoral campaign and we want to achieve the best result.</p>\r\n<p>At the same time, we can not declare that for PDM it is vital to have the function of the President of the Republic of Moldova, this approach is not correct. In any case, the Party will stay strong and will govern. But it is vital that this function will not get to other people that have no project for Moldovans, people who want to gain this function only to provoke chaos and instability in this country, people that are in fact the represents of some mob groups or promoters of occult interests from outside of the country.</p>\r\n<p>In the campaign we will prove what is the project and vision of Marian Lupu for Moldova, we will prove that we are the only ones that truly can solve the problems of Moldovans. We enter in the campaign to offer a good President, but also to inform the citizens about our political vision.</p>\r\n<p><strong>T: What are the chances of Marian Lupu to accede in the second tour? </strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>V.P.:</strong> High chances, if we consider the last two opinion polls that we made. The tendencies are very good, and we are all working like Marian Lupu not only to accede in the second tour, but also to do it with a high score and after that to win.</p>\r\n<p><strong>T: What exactly are showing the opinion polls and why you are not publishing them? </strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>V.P.:</strong> They are showing more clearly that the people is not willing any more to believe in false heroes and created over night or over summer parties, they are showing that the people is sick to assist at accusations and wars, they are showing more important things that we will take into consideration. PDM is making periodical public polls, not only on the eve of elections, but they are working surveys, we do not publish them because we do not want to influence people in any way. The fact is that sociological data mobilize us and makes us confident in victory.</p>\r\n<p><strong>T: Will Marian Lupu have the active support of the Prime-Minister Filip in the campaign, he will have support and from its colleagues from Government?  </strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>V.P.:</strong> Our Party has the most united and liable political team. But I think that the best support that our Party colleagues from Government can offer to our nominee is not to be involved institutionally in the campaign, but to work actively at the Government, to work there, to work for people and to obtain results. This is already enough for our people to see that PDM team is professional and efficient, and this thing is certainly will bring, indirectly, positive results to Marian Lupu as well in the electoral campaign. For the Government it is important now to sign the agreement with IMF and the general cleaning which, along with other institutions they must do in the banking sector, but not in the electoral campaign.       </p>\r\n<p><strong>T: Is the force actions from the last period helping the PDM nominee? I refer to those resonance cases and arrest of the judges… </strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>V.P.: </strong>Somebody told me I the past days that what is happening lately is reminding him of the 2001-2002 years, when it was made that cleaning by arresting those thieves in law who were terrorizing Moldova back in that days. However, in my opinion, the situation is different now because now we do not have no thieves in law, but sophisticated criminal groups, financed with big amount of money, inclusively from outside of the country, but there are also some similarities with that moment.</p>\r\n<p>As a matter of fact, if a cleaning in the justice is made, or in other sectors, in the first place this helps a lot the country, no matter who is doing this. The important thing is to clean this up, these actions to be managed professionally and objectively, not to be limiting themselves only to one zone, but to tackle head-on and on a large scale the whole phenomenon of corruption.</p>\r\n<p><strong>T: Some say that the arrest of the judges could not be made without your approval. Did you approve it?   </strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>V.P.:</strong> I approve now in advance and for further actions of this kind, even if I do not know who they are. If good things like this depend on my approval than I give my approval to make order in the country.</p>\r\n<p>If there are some who are waiting for my approval, I hope they read very attentive this interview and to get to work right away, either it is about cleaning in the customs sector, in the health one or others.</p>\r\n<p>And in order to finally get out of these speculations, I tell you definitely that, until I have influence through my position, I will manifest it active in supporting of reforms, inclusively in the justice sector, there were my political support or PDM support.</p>\r\n<p>I have involved myself until now, starting with the initiation of the new Government, when along with my coalition partners, we supported actively all that came from the Government and from the negotiation team with IMF. There were registered positive results and we won’t stop here, there will be started and other complicated reforms of big social service.</p>\r\n<p><strong>T: What will happen with all this plans if there will be another President beside PDM’s nominee? </strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>V.P.:</strong> We will realize them anyhow, they do not depend on who is the President, and they depend by the political will of the Parliament and by the support that will have the Government. But o think everyone understands politically and mathematically, and at the attitude level, that the only one from the candidates that can ensure stability, peace and an efficient collaboration between state institutions, President, Government and Parliament after the elections, is Marian Lupu.    </p>\r\n<p><strong>T: But if there will be anticipated elections, as some candidates are announcing</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>V.P.: </strong>Those candidates who are threatening that will launch anticipated elections should take the Constitution, because they are going in the electoral race without knowing the fundamental law and they will make a fool of themselves. The story of anticipated elections is only a cheap demagogy to trick the people, as they did with the protests. They brought them to the protests only to create a Party on the back and emotions of the people, and now they want to become Presidents through a new trick towards Moldovans.</p>\r\n<p><strong>T: Did the protests scare you?</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>V.P.:</strong> The protests have two important signals. The most important one is because of some problems from society, especially social ones that the government took over.</p>\r\n<p>Some of them, as you know, they solved, others they still must solve in the near future and they will solve them, inclusively through some harsh reforms that we are going to launch, others in the immediate future, because there are people that cannot wait until after the elections, as is the banking sector and its full stabilization.</p>\r\n<p>On the other side the protest revealed to all some interconnected that were acting with very obvious methods of organized criminality, they being constitute of shady people, politicians, officials and employees of some interest circles from outside of the country.</p>\r\n<p>Slowly, all of them were disclosed. For instance, before one of these groups to take over the DA Platform, they did not know of some links between its members and leaders, they did not know a lot of data about their methods of action and the provenience of the illegal funds that they are using. </p>\r\n<p>Thanks to the protests that they organized we could find out a lot about them, those from the shadows revealed themselves and this allowed us to avoid a bigger escalation of the situation and a thoroughness political crisis of the country. More than that, this will allow us to be more prepared and more decided of our combat measures if the attempts to destabilize the situation in the country.</p>\r\n<p><strong>T: Who leads these groups? </strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>V.P.:</strong> Not necessary only one person, it’s an entity much more complicated. Those groups are lead by the dirty interests of the top members, it is about the Topa clan, the Platon group, the tiny group of Renato Usatai, who took under them some parties, journalists, and state employees, and introduced their own people in the rows of the civil society to have succseful and credible as more as possible, inclusively in the diplomatic zone.</p>\r\n<p>But all these are now visible and I think that in the period to come the will be more undisputed. What I consider truly dangerous is that they are capable to make worse the Moldova’s image outside of the country, poisoning the international media with false information and extremely dangerous for the country. </p>\r\n<p><strong>T: Why you did not spoke about these groups and its links earlier?  </strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>V.P.:</strong> Let’s not pretend that we are naive, I am not telling you now no news, all that I am telling you at this moment is seen very clearly for a long time. I am not the first one who flags these ugly events. </p>\r\n<p><strong>T: From where do you know all this, from the notebook that is speaking that was found when he was arrested? </strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>V.P.:</strong> No, I know from the press. More precisely, from the press.  </p>\r\n<p><strong>T: How from the press? </strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>V.P.: </strong>When you want to understand better who and with whom he is tied and what he is planning, you only need to read the news from different sites, to make an effort and to read between the lines for a little bit and you already know the hidden agenda of the group that I am was talking about.  </p>\r\n<p><strong> T: Why you don’t give the names of the journalists or media institutions that are doing this? </strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>V.P.:</strong> I do not want to ruin their work, they are doing a great job and their products are useful in a way. If they would not write, we would not know so much. </p>\r\n<p><strong>T: Then I will give a name – Veaceslav Platon. He says that you arrested him. How do you comment his accusation? </strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>V.P.:</strong> All those who were arrested are saying the same story already. In the moment someone is arrested, in that moment my name is tagged. This is also a message and a signal that if we analyze it beyond their victimization campaign, you will discover useful information.</p>\r\n<p>The situation with Platon is complicated and the concern on his case is very big from those who have participated with him at all his illegalities, as in Moldova, as outside of the country, but also of those who were behind him. Because it is already obvious that Platon did not manage its own money, he did not have such money, he was only the guy with the schemes of laundering of the money, he was the one who placed the money and funding various illegal actions.   </p>\r\n<p>He and his whole group is attacking me, hopping that I will be intimidated, and I will do all to help him, and in return, they will not accuse us. I of course will not crack under their psychological pressures, they can accuse me further of all they can came up for. The justice must do their work, to do it objectively and fair, and the damage brought to the state to be recovered, the thieves and the corrupted ones to stay in prison.</p>\r\n<p>What I am doing now, is, that together with the colleagues from the coalition to support the Government and other responsible institutions to approve laws for enforcing the banking system and measures for cleaning it, that in the case if other Platon appear, they could not do all this schlock that they did. I assure you that we will solve this problem in the immediate future.</p>\r\n<p><strong>T: Why this has not been done in advance, we would have avoided so many serious situations?</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>V.P.:</strong> Because the parties were busy with the political battles, fights of arrogance, fights with imaginary enemies and outbreak of different crises. It is easy to manipulate the public opinion and to turn it against an unreal enemy, only in order to cover your thefts. This is what some of them have been doing lately and look in what stressed and difficult situations we are.</p>\r\n<p>However, the time doesn’t forgive, sooner or later, the people realize that were tricked, and at that time you suffer twice, you loose completely their support, they don’t believe you anymore, and then you also pay for the thefts that you covered under this staged fights.</p>\r\n<p>On the short term, maybe this approach brought someone benefits, new parties were created on the confrontation’s background, new heroes and heroines appeared, political stars, but on the long term the effect is disastrous for them, when the population is going to find out that was lain, will put these heroes on their place, as the parties built on the basis of confrontation and scandal.</p>\r\n<p>I understand very well the mistakes that we made, PDM, I personally, by the way I handled these virulent attacks upon us, and we suffered from prejudices to the image, I suffered politically, but it's important that we learn from our mistakes and now we have another approach, which gives positive results.</p>\r\n<p><strong>T: How the coalitions did not function until now and now they function, what are you doing?</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>V.P.:</strong> Multiple disruptive factors have disappeared, like the desperate fights for posts, arrogance, the destructive competition between parties inside the coalition. The government acts silently, minds its own business and doesn’t interfere with the politics only when needs the support of the Parliament.</p>\r\n<p><strong>T: Speaking about posts, are you going to Prime Minister after the elections, as I have read somewhere?</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>V.P.:</strong> It seems that you have read the web-sites I was telling you earlier, right? Try to see what intentions have those behind such news and you will have the answers.</p>\r\n<p>I do not intend to go into any post, a priority for me now is to support the government to implement the reforms agreed with the IMF and other emergencies to streamline the institutions and another goal of mine is about reforming PDM and preparing for the elections in 2018. As announced above, PDM will go through an extensive process of modernization, which will get it closer to people. These objectives are important and demanding enough to leave no room for other occupations and posts.</p>\r\n<p>If I understood a thing from the past six years experience is that it is time for parties to look and behave as voters want, not politicians. Classical parties of all real democracies must understand and reform in this respect, because otherwise we leave room for extremists, fools in the leading and opportunists to make tests on citizens for their anarchic experiments.</p>\r\n<p><strong>T: What is your relationship with Igor Dodon? It is rumoured to be your candidate.</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>V.P.:</strong> Not only about him this is said, I saw that the newest news is about Maia Sandu who is also my candidate. All of them are mine and I support them. With this statement I think I halved the rating of some of them.</p>\r\n<p>Joking aside, what some malevolent people did not understand yet is that the battle with the Plahotniuc myth is not anymore what it was, soon will be more and more people who will understand what this fight was really about. This is why those who made PR and parties based on this war with my name are very afraid. Because it was a war with my name, not with me.</p>\r\n<p>For them these elections are the last chance, because if they lose the election now, go into anonymity, people will forget them. These people understand that every achievement of the Government and external appreciation of the government destroys step by step the myth created in connection with PDM and me. These people know what potential I have, they know what potential has the team of PDM and understand that if we stay in power for a sufficient period of time, we have the ability to do good things for people and gain confidence, but this means the end of these cardboard heroes, the end of the political clowns and parties they have created by myths. Under slogans like \"I am not afraid\" is actually hiding a terrible fear that the current government might succeed to bring welfare and order for Moldovans. Here is the key where should be interpreted someone's desperation, and all sorts of gossip and speculation.</p>\r\n<p><strong>T: Who owns Gofman?</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>V.P.:</strong> Platon and the leaders of Platon. He was the key man in all the money launderings made in Moldova. He ran to USA and tried to play the dissident in order to victimize himself and hide the implication in the laundering of that 20 billions of US dollars, but I think that is already clear to all the people what is with him and to whom he belongs.</p>\r\n<p><strong>T: He presented documents showing that he informed the management about the situation at BEM.</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>V.P.:</strong> Such documents even you can make, they do not have any relevance, it is important how he acted, and how he acted is seen, is known.</p>\r\n<p><strong>T: Is Shor your man? Do you protect him, do you use him?</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>V.P.:</strong> Shor, like all others involved, must answer for what he did. In this case also my name is invoked by those who have done business with him, they used it, and now are upset that he gave depositions on them and label him as that is my man to discredit him and get rid of responsibility.</p>\r\n<p>For my part, they can finger each other every day and night, to say what they want, it's important to learn the truth and all of them to answer for their deeds and, of course, to recover all the money back. Nobody should receive clemency or protection.</p>\r\n<p><strong>T: What </strong><strong>statements made Andrei Nastase in the U.S. concerning the BEM investigation and at what institutions? Because he does not want to offer details. You must know.</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>V.P.:</strong> What kind of details? That he flew to the U.S. and testified at McDonald’s? Let’s be serious: this guy hasn’t yet overcome the stage of a clown: you see him wandering as an insane man from country to country and nobody wants to meet him, don’t you? I cannot answer you more seriously. Let him wander on about fast food restaurants in the U.S. and Europe.</p>\r\n<p><strong>T: What is your opinion about Maia Sandu? How the government will work with her if she becomes President? Especially, since she attacks you and PDM very often.</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong> V.P.:</strong> I do not have an opinion, I know her just when she was part of the two governments with us. Nor in the first government, nor in the second, she had no problem to become minister with the votes from PDM and even with my vote. Strangely, all her public critics to our address appeared after PLDM did not choose her as Minister. Only then she left the government and made her own party.</p>\r\n<p>Maybe she needed the attacks over me in order to create and enlarge her party, and I do not see any problem here, I told you that there are some parties that were built like this. They do not have any political project, do not show any vision, are fighting only with imaginary enemies and their leaders act as saints or martyrs. However, we had these kind of saints and martyrs…</p>\r\n<p>I do not think that is the case to analyze too much how she could collaborate with the government, because I think that “Topa” will take care to withdraw her from the elections or to bring her at a score as low as possible.</p>\r\n<p><strong>T: Will we have fair elections? There are already accusations from opposition that the elections could be rigged.</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>V.P.:</strong> The signals and speculation you speak about belong to some who saw the survey where Marian Lupu and PDM party have registered a significant increase, the tendency confirmed by our sociological data. The idea is that there are some candidates who understand that Marian Lupu  will enter the second round and through these fraud allegations they are preparing the justification of their fail. Just because we know these positive trends related to the development of our candidate, we are most interested in the elections to be fair and transparent.</p>\r\n<p>So we understand their strategy and we will do everything necessary for the elections to be maximum transparent and will insist on a high number of foreign observers, as there was at no election, even if this will mean large amount of money spending, but it is important that elections in Moldova are strictly monitored by external partners</p>\r\n<p>Their victimization strategy will not succeed, nor the challenges that we already know they are preparing for election day. This is the only thing they can do, they are not capable of a political project for the presidential candidate, their only electoral weapon is whining on TV, because they have nothing to suggest, nothing depends on them, they know they can't give people something other than words. But I think the candidates' words in this campaign will count least.<strong> </strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>T: Why don’t you appear more often in the public, you said that you will communicate more often with the people?</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>V.P.:</strong> Better than me no one can deliver to the people my message, so I communicate directly with them, through my actions and direct interactions. Sometimes I make it through media. However, I am not in a hurry, I do not need daily appearances in the press to appear about me, I did not propose to myself to change like this my image. I know that time will solve very well and my image issue, this process has already began, so I do not have any reasons to force these things. However I like to talk to people through my projects and the actions I make, I allow myself to follow this path, because I am not dependent of any post, I do not need to lie to the people to vote me, I do not candidate to anything, from this point of view I have a freedom that I cherish very much.</p>\r\n<p><strong>T: It is a long interview and there are many questions left, I propose you to continue this interview in the near period. </strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>V.P.:</strong> I do not promise that it will be very soon, I think that an interview per month is enough, I answered with pleasure when there are more topics, but I do not want to give any interview just to be present in the media.</p>\r\n<p><strong>T: Thank you for your answers.</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong>V.P.:</strong> I thank you too.</p>\r\n<p> </p>\r\n<p>Source:<a href=\"http://tribuna.md/2016/09/27/interviu-vlad-plahotniuc-a-venit-vremea-ca-partidele-sa-arate-si-sa-se-comporte-asa-cum-vor-alegatorii/\" target=\"_blank\"> Tribuna</a></p>",

                "lead": "For the second time in its history of over 650 years, Moldova will be able to choose its head of state by a popular vote, will chose between at least two candidates. In 1996, Mr. Petru Lucinschi became president after gathering over 919,831 votes. No other party or person managed to get so many votes in Moldova in a competition with one or more counter-candidates. The stake of the presidential elections in 2016 is very high because for the first time in twenty years one person has a chance to be voted by nearly one million Moldovan citizens, which will lend him a certain legitimacy and popular support, and responsibility.",
                "Continut": "<p>There are discussions about the fairness of the vote, which are based on several misunderstandings over the methodological approach or the definition than the actual situation. I will try to list the elements of this context:</p>\r\n<p>1. <strong>There is made a misapprehension between the number of citizens of Moldova with right to vote and the present population. </strong>It is no secret that we have more citizens than people de facto in the Republic of Moldova, but this is not a reason to deprive our citizens abroad of the right to vote as long as they have not renounced their citizenship.</p>\r\n<p>2. <strong>Data from the 2014 Population Census have not been published yet.</strong> The preliminary data were presented hurryingly and have nothing to do with the logic. According to them, the population of Chisinau would be below 500 thousand people, or about 300 thousand less than in 2014. However, there is no reason to believe that the population of Chisinau has declined that much, while the population of other regions diminished insignificantly. The good news is that on September 20, 2016, over 82% of the Population Census questionnaires were processed, thus in about a month we could start receiving the first results. Anyway, there will always be suspicions about their quality.</p>\r\n<p>3. <strong>There is a systemic problem in the management of governmental data. </strong>For some reasons, there is the State Register of Voters (SRV) and separately - the State Register of Population (SRP). There is only one condition for people from SRP to get in the SRV - to reach the age of 18. That is all. Any specialist in databases, even a beginner will say it's redundant to keep two registers. Purely technical, SRV should be a selection from SRP done before the elections, where to include the information on alive people with the age of 18 and more.</p>\r\n<p>4. <strong>\"The million problem.\" </strong>In the national consciousness deepened the idea that one million people are currently abroad, although no one has presented any other information about this \"million\": what countries it is distributed in, neither its structure on age, ethnic composition, education, etc. The Population decline by one million does not explain why the Gross Domestic Product continues to grow. On the contrary, there were supposed to be some catastrophic consequences on the indicators. An analysis of consumption – the largest GDP component, shows us that the number of people abroad may not be so great. Due to the \"million\" effect, there is no an accurate assessment of the current situation in several areas, including the electoral one.</p>\r\n<p>5. <strong>The issue of the dead ones.</strong> If in the past there was chaos in the electoral lists that were updated arbitrarily, then now should not be such a problem. As in the case of the dear departed Emil Loteanu, there are Moldovans settled abroad who died and nobody informed SRP or SRV that this person is no longer considered \"alive.\" Of course, beside the reduction of the number of registers from two to one, other measures of legislative nature for a person to be declared dead are also needed. For example, a model exists on Facebook - either a death certificate is attached or a number of people confirms that the person is deceased. Furthermore, if a person does not receive any public service, does not appear in any database for a specific period, it may be investigated whether that person is alive or not. Certainly, other solutions could also be found.</p>\r\n<p>6. <strong>The demographic structure changed dramatically in the last 25 years.</strong> At the beginning of the 90’s, the population of Moldova was bigger, and even younger, than nowadays. In the 80’s many children were born, who can vote now. In this way, a paradox occurs: we have a decreasing population, but an increasing number of voters. However, since the children born after independence are in a far smaller number, and soon the number of voters will begin to decline.</p>\r\n<p>7. <strong>The Transnistrian problem</strong>. For various reasons, many ignore the fact that in the Transnistrian region live people, and most of them have the Moldovan citizenship. Of course, there were no elections in which they have participated massively, but yet they are Moldovan citizens and have the right to vote. Therefore, add about 490 thousands to the population of Moldova, about 270 thousands to the number of voters and about 210 thousands to the number of citizens (estimated data). I mention that all these three indicators are different.</p>\r\n<p>\n\t\t\t<div class=\"cs_img \"  style=\"width:777px;\">\n\t\t\t <p><a href=\"/images/cms-image-000001766.png\" class=\"photoViewer\" title=\"\"> \t\t\t\t<img src=\"/get_img?ImageRatio=70&amp;ImageWidth=777&amp;ImageHeight=319&amp;ImageId=1766\"   border=\"0\"/>\n\t\t\t </a></p> \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\n </p>\r\n<p>Here at least 7 SERIOUS reasons of confusion, which makes most of the assumptions on how accurate are certain data to be incorrect.</p>\r\n<p>I made an appraisal of the migratory balance for the period 1991-2015. I found it curious that since 2012, there are more foreigners who obtain Moldovan citizenship than those who give it up. In total, for 4 years, 14.838 people obtained the Moldovan citizenship, mostly Romanians (17%), Arabs (13%), Ukrainians (13%), Russians (12%) and Turks (10%). On the other hand, in the same period 10.257 Moldovan citizens emigrated. Most went to Ukraine (32%) and Russia (31%). But here I refer only to the citizens who emigrated permanently.</p>\r\n<p>It is not clear to what extent the increasing number of immigrants influences the electoral process and if some of them simply want to benefit from Moldovan passport to travel to EU without a visa. However, their number will be small soon and even this will not be an advantage, at least for the Ukrainian citizens who will be able to travel with no visa to EU.</p>\r\n<p>If we take the whole period after independence, we lost about 135 thousand citizens who have emigrated and no longer hold citizenship of Moldova. We also have about 53 thousand immigrants and about 59 thousand repatriated. It should be noted that the number of the new returnees was higher in the 90s and is quite small now.</p>\r\n<p><strong>How many are abroad?</strong> To answer this question I have created a model that takes into account the natural increase and migration in 1991-2015. Thus, according to the NBS in 2015 were 325.4 thousand people who went temporarily abroad. In the model, we found a difference of about 120 thousand people - who should be citizens of Moldova, but are not covered by NBS data. Therefore, we have abroad 445.4 thousand Moldovan citizens who may come back.</p>\r\n<p>At this number we add 135 thousand people who emigrated definitively. In addition, we can take into account the natural increase among the migrated population (120 thousand not covered by NBS and 135 thousand who emigrated definitively). No one knows exactly how many children were born abroad among migrants who have left, but let us assume that their number is at least 40% of 255 thousand \"lost\" citizens, which means another 102 thousand people who could have been part of the present population in Moldova. Regarding the number of the dead, I will use an arbitrary number, because such data are difficult to estimate - 25 thousand people.</p>\r\n<p>Finally, we have, <strong>657.4 thousand people, </strong>who left permanently or temporarily, including the children born abroad without the citizenship of Moldova. </p>\r\n<p><strong>Who is left in the country to vote? </strong>CEC data on the number of voters in SRV are just a few thousand more than in my simulation model of the number of population of the country from 1991 to 2016. So the error can be in several thousand unregistered deceased citizens, which would be about 3-5 thousand in total.</p>\r\n<p>Hence, from the total number of over 3.2 million voters from SRV, really could vote more than 2.5 million people who are in the country, and if we had a real rate of participation of 60%, we could expect 1.5 million voters at the ballot boxes. For example, in 2015, 1.38 million persons voted for the mayors in their municipalities, which would be 55.2% from the base of 2.5 million potential voters, which seems reasonable.</p>\r\n<p>Of course, the official participation rate will be lower because it will be divided by 3.2 million. In this context, it is necessary to decrease the electoral threshold and any barriers to the registration of candidates because the present population is declining, even though the number of citizens decreases slower.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Conclusively:</strong> CEC data are not perfect, but close enough to reality. </p>\r\n<p><strong>Data source:</strong> National Bureau of Statistics (<a href=\"http://www.statistica.md/\">www.statistica.md</a>), Central Electoral Commission (<a href=\"http://www.cec.md/\">www.cec.md</a>) and iData calculations.</p>",

The leader of the Dignity and Truth Platform Party had a meeting yesterday with the honorary President of the party \"Ravnopravie\" (Socio-Political Movement Equality - Ed.) at Radisson Blu. The moment was caught on camera by the photographer Constantin Grigorita. A meeting that Valerii Klimenko confirmed, but refused to give details about.",
                "Continut": "<blockquote>\r\n<p><em>\"I confirm the meeting with Nastase. A true politician is obliged to meet with other politicians, otherwise he cannot be called a politician. Politicians need to meet to discuss the situation in the country and ways of solving the problems. They should think about the country,\"</em> declared Klimenko.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>\n\t\t\t<div class=\"cs_img \"  style=\"width:716.8000000000001px;\">\n\t\t\t <p><a href=\"/images/cms-image-000001782.jpg\" class=\"photoViewer\" title=\"Andrei Năstase şi Valerii Klimenko, în faţa hotelului Leogrand\"> \t\t\t\t<img src=\"/get_img?ImageRatio=35&amp;ImageWidth=716&amp;ImageHeight=476&amp;ImageId=1782\" alt=\"Andrei Năstase şi Valerii Klimenko, în faţa hotelului Leogrand\" title=\"Andrei Năstase şi Valerii Klimenko, în faţa hotelului Leogrand\"  border=\"0\"/>\n\t\t\t </a></p> \t\t\t                                    <p class=\"cs_img_caption\">Andrei Năstase şi Valerii Klimenko, în faţa hotelului Leogrand</p>\n                            \t\t</div>\n\t\n</p>\r\n<p>He wanted to associate the meeting with Nastase, with the ones that US officials have with those from Iran despite tense relations between the countries.</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p><em>\"An example is the USA and Iran, how badly they would not scold, at one moment they had no choice but to sit at the negotiating table. There are many examples like this one. I am meeting with all the politicians, except those who support the liquidation of Moldova,\" </em>he concluded by referring to the supporters of the unionist current. </p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>\n\t\t\t<div class=\"cs_img \"  style=\"width:716.8000000000001px;\">\n\t\t\t <p><a href=\"/images/cms-image-000001785.jpg\" class=\"photoViewer\" title=\"Andrei Năstase şi Valerii Klimenko, în faţa hotelului Leogrand\"> \t\t\t\t<img src=\"/get_img?ImageRatio=35&amp;ImageWidth=716&amp;ImageHeight=476&amp;ImageId=1785\" alt=\"Andrei Năstase şi Valerii Klimenko, în faţa hotelului Leogrand\" title=\"Andrei Năstase şi Valerii Klimenko, în faţa hotelului Leogrand\"  border=\"0\"/>\n\t\t\t </a></p> \t\t\t                                    <p class=\"cs_img_caption\">Andrei Năstase şi Valerii Klimenko, în faţa hotelului Leogrand</p>\n                            \t\t</div>\n\t\n</p>\r\n<p>When we became more insistent and tried to find out what topics he discussed with Andrei Nastase, Klimenko told us that he could not talk anymore and hung up. We tried to find out details from the PPDA leader, but the result was the same as all our attempts to contact him - he has not answered the phone.</p>\r\n<p>Due to the lack of details, it is difficult to say how long the meeting lasted, whether it was planned or if it took place in the context of any other event. We hope that both politicians concerned to come up publicly with some explanations on this subject.</p>\r\n<p>\n\t\t\t<div class=\"cs_img \"  style=\"width:702.9px;\">\n\t\t\t <p><a href=\"/images/cms-image-000001784.jpg\" class=\"photoViewer\" title=\"Andrei Năstase şi Valerii Klimenko, în faţa hotelului Leogrand\"> \t\t\t\t<img src=\"/get_img?ImageWidth=702&amp;ImageHeight=1056&amp;ImageId=1784\" alt=\"Andrei Năstase şi Valerii Klimenko, în faţa hotelului Leogrand\" title=\"Andrei Năstase şi Valerii Klimenko, în faţa hotelului Leogrand\"  border=\"0\"/>\n\t\t\t </a></p> \t\t\t                                    <p class=\"cs_img_caption\">Andrei Năstase şi Valerii Klimenko, în faţa hotelului Leogrand</p>\n                            \t\t</div>\n\t\n</p>\r\n<p>We remind you that after the arrest of Ilan Shor that happened earlier this summer, Andrei Nastase commented, <em>\"Detaining the \"Little Mouse\" is part of a treacherous game, with an electoral hint, made by the pimp Plahotniuc and his tool, Shor, in order to eliminate from the electoral campaign the message that incriminates him, the theft of the billion\".</em></p>\r\n<p>In the context of this meeting we must remind the repeated protests of the residents of Orhei at the head office of Jurnal TV - the TV station close to the group that includes Andrei Nastase.</p>\r\n<p>\n\t\t\t<div class=\"cs_img \"  style=\"width:705.25px;\">\n\t\t\t <p><a href=\"/images/cms-image-000001787.jpg\" class=\"photoViewer\" title=\"\"> \t\t\t\t<img src=\"/get_img?ImageRatio=65&amp;ImageWidth=705&amp;ImageHeight=343&amp;ImageId=1787\"   border=\"0\"/>\n\t\t\t </a></p> \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\n</p>",

Let us not forget that we live in the era of informational technologies and electronic communication that is why you will be able to see my speech online, on which, I must admit, I worked and prepared thoroughly. You'll find there many numbers and arguments that come to disprove this motion of no confidence. I think it is a correct decision of the parliamentary majority not to provide a platform for political show to those who submitted the vote of no confidence. It is a frivolous, cynical and demagogic motion\", </em>he declared.  </p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>We remind that the Permanent Bureau decided to organize a special meeting today to discuss the no-confidence motion against the Filip Government, initiated by PSRM, PCRM and PLDM. However, the meeting did not take place due to lack of quorum after the MPs of the parliamentary majority have announced that they will not participate at it, classifying it as an electoral show.</p>\r\n<p>Although, he expressed his regret for not reading his speech in the plenary, it seems that the Prime Minister did not intend to do so. At least that results from the fact that Pavel Filip had to be present in the Parliament at 12:00 AM, and just over half an hour had already planned a meeting with his Belorussian counterpart, Andrei Kobeacov.</p>\r\n<p>Shortly, after the fail of the no-confidence motion, on the official page of the Government was published the speech that the Prime Minister Filip referred to.</p>",

                "lead": "The Democratic Party candidate, Marian Lupu considers that his only opponent in the electoral campaign for the presidential elections at the end of this month is the socialist Igor Dodon. Moreover, Lupu said that the PSRM leader is the most dangerous candidate who would like to change Moldova's European course, but also federalize the country.",
                "Continut": "<p>In an interview for the agency <a href=\"http://ipn.md/ro/politica/79414\">Info-Prim Neo</a>, the candidate of the democrats says that the socialist is just <em>„an enforcer of a political project elaborated outside of Moldova”</em></p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p><em>\"I'm talking about a highly sophisticated project, which aims among the rests also the federalization of the country, tearing Moldova to pieces. Dodon wants to become president in order to give up the European integration and the Association Agreement, processes that offered the greatest benefits to Moldovans, and stated this so may times lately,\"</em> added Marian Lupu. </p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>In the same context, the president of the Democratic Party is referring also to the candidate our party, Dumitru Ciubasenco whom he qualifies as <em>\"just a background performer in the campaign\"</em> because <em>\"he is working for a honorarium as he is used to, as he was once on the parliamentary list with Filat, while now he is the weapon of Usatii against Dodon.\"</em></p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p><em>\"They have their own game on the left-wing, a rivalry similar to the one of Maia Sandu and Nastase, also with angers that they do not know who is a better candidate.They would also deal with this even in the case they become the president of the country, fighting with arrogances and frustrations,\"</em><em> </em>said the interviewee.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>As for Maia Sandu and Andrei Nastase, the Democrat believes that they want to destabilize the situation in Moldova and believes that the leader of PAS only has been used by Andrei Nastase and people that stand behind him, referring to the two Topa, trying to manipulate her in choosing for a common candidate.</p>\r\n<blockquote><em>\"Maia Sandu is scared of what's happening and I humanly understand her. She realizes only now that she has fallen into the trap of the two Topa and Nastase, they held her captive on the idea of a common candidate in order to remove her from the electoral race. Now she understands that she fell into this trap, but she lost valuable time which she cannot recover any more. While she was sleeping with the idea of a single candidate, Nastase made his campaign stronger, playing dirty in order to gain ground. It is very ugly what they did with Maia. I am convinced that Topa brothers have never had even a little intention to withdraw from the race their puppet and support Maia Sandu,\" </em>stated Marian Lupu.</blockquote>\r\n<p>According to the PD candidate, Andrei Nastase <em>\"wants to do as President what he was unable to do as a prosecutor and attorney, to get the thieves off the hook, to classify the cases in which they are convicted, to escape </em><em>his financiers and the financiers of DA Platform </em><em>from the punishment.\"</em></p>\r\n<p><em>\"What can solve Nastase, even multiplied by two? Especially since he has the Topa brothers behind him, another duet of criminal businessmen, convicted inclusively for embezzlement from BEM\", </em>added the Democrat<em>, </em>reminding that<em> \"Andrei Nastase agreed with Dodon and Usatîi to put on hold the process of Moldova's European integration, as you remember he said in a TV show.\"</em></p>",

                "Continut": "<p>In this sense we asked for the opinion of the Anti-corruption prosecutor, Viorel Morari, who stated that the CEC's decision is legal, but, in Shor's case it contradicts with the court decision taken previously. According to the prosecutor, Ilan Shor must remain in house arrest to avoid the contact with witnesses and to influence them.  </p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p><em>\"CEC's adjudication of a request regarding a potential right in the electoral process is lawful, but in Shor's case, this right contradicts with court's decision, which was issued to ensure the smooth conduct of the investigation. The prosecutors motivated the necessity of preventive measure of arrest and, in my opinion, it not changed any circumstances that would change that decision of the court regarding on his house arrest. Shor must stay in custody to avoid contact with witnesses and influencing people,\"</em> stated Viorel Morari for Deschide.MD.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>More that that, Morari claims that in case the court will accept to change the preventive measures, this would mean that the measure of house arrest applied previously, was illegal.  </p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p><em>\"In case if Shor's defense will request his release from house arrest to exercise the right which went to him through the CEC's decision, and the court will accept the position of the lawyers, this will mean that the decision on the measure of house arrest was illegal,”</em> said Morari. </p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>We remind that yesterday Central Electoral Commission registered Ilan Shor as a trustworthy person of Inna Popenco, who runs for President of the Republic of Moldova from the Social-Political Movement \"Ravnopravie\", lead by Ilan Shor. </p>\r\n<p>According to the Electoral Code, the trustworthy person \"helps the candidate at the development of electoral campaign, does electioneering for his election, represents his interests in relations with public authorities, voters and electoral bodies.\" In this sense, Shor's defense may request the release of Ilan Shor under house arrest to carry out the duties provided by law.</p>",

                "lead": "At the NATO Information and Documentation Centre has been launched the \"Hybrid Warfare a la russe” study, signed by the Expert in Foreign Politics and Security from the Russian Federation, Yuri Feodorov.",
                "Continut": "<p>The study was published with the support of the Center for Army, Conversion and Disarmament Studies (Ukraine) and provides an analysis of the hybrid warfare led by Russia against Ukraine. The study also presents information on hybrid warfare strategy, character and structure of hybrid forces in Russia, hybrid war tactics, planning and preparing for classic war against Ukraine. The work is also an account of the support offered by Russia to the organizations of the extreme right and ultra-nationalistic Europe, about the role of the Foreign Intelligence Service of the Russian Federation in the hybrid warfare, the right and neo-fascist radical organizations financed by Russia, Russian propaganda in Europe, etc.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Eastern Military District - the most powerful in Russia </strong></p>\r\n<p>The author mentioned that the reason for starting a hybrid warfare against Ukraine, but also throughout all the post-Soviet space, is linked to Putin's ambitions and the people from his entourage to behave as major leaders on global and regional level. This trend is fueled by the political thinking of the Russian Federation, which does not accepts until today the idea of disintegration of the Soviet empire.</p>\r\n<p>It is assumed that Russia has prepared a hybrid warfare, which was to occur in parallel with a classic war after the first Maidan in Ukraine, i.e. \"Orange Revolution\" of 2004 in which came out victorious the Yushchenko - Tymoshenko tandem. But the war in Chechnya and the war against Georgia in 2008 proved that Russia was not prepared for a major assault against Ukraine. Then, in 2008, they began to implement the reform of the Russian Army, which is scheduled to end in 2020. Under this reform were created the military districts, and the strongest - in terms of fighting ability - is South Military District, which, by the way, is part of the Russian Taskforce troops from Transnistria.</p>\r\n<p><strong>Putin did not expect that Ukraine will <strong>stand up against</strong> Novorossiya</strong></p>\r\n<p>The Novorossiya project was part of the hybrid warfare. Ukraine, however, managed to fight against this project. At the half of 2015 year, it became clear that Moscow failed to achieve the goals that it has proposed in early 2014: to transform Ukraine into a protectorate of Russia, to crumble regions of south-eastern Ukraine and to create such a quasi-state under the name of \"Novorossiya\", that would be led de facto by Russia, to achieve federalization of Ukraine, but also to destabilize the power in Kiev through economic pressures and military actions in Donbas. Putin simply underestimated the determination of the Ukrainian society and a large part of the Ukrainian elites to oppose Russian aggression, but also the ability of US and EU to impose sanctions on Russia. Putin did not take into account also the capacity of the Ukrainian authorities to repress diversionary and terrorist groups in the Odessa region, Kharkiv and other regions of southeastern Ukraine within 3-4 months after the fall of Yanukovych regime. Thus, the Ukrainian authorities did not allow to expand the hybrid war beyond the territory of Donbas.</p>\r\n<p>\"If Ukraine have failed to stop the Novorossiya project, i.e. thwarting the separatist scenarios in regions of Dnipropetrovsk, Kharkiv, Odesa, today, the Russian army would be on the border with Romania and would have caused a conflict with NATO,\" stated Yuri Fedorov.</p>\r\n<p>The expert concluded that the next hybrid warfare that will lead Putin against his own people, because it will increase the dissatisfaction with lower living standards within Russian people, and this will be due to decreasing the exports and energy resources, including the natural gas. Namely because of that Putin created the National Guard which is directly subject to him.</p>\r\n<p><strong>How Russia legalizes its Armed Forces   </strong></p>\r\n<p>Since 2015, Vladimir Putin signed a decree allowing all those who speak Russian to become mercenaries in the Russian Army. Thus, the inhabitants of Donetsk and Lugansk regions, learning about this, began to enlist legally in the Russian Army. \"According to our information, the first and second military corp, which fights against Ukraine, consists exclusively of people that are living in these regions,\" stated Mykhailo Samus, the deputy director of the Center for Army, Conversion and Disarmament Studies in Ukraine. Thus, Russia has begun to work legally with the separatists to control the money they transfer to people. The Armed Forces from the occupied territories are some brigades, battalions that are part of regular Armed Forces of the Russian Federation. All these people are fighting in Donbas and wearing the inscription DNR People Militia need salaries, social payments, leave money etc. Russia preferred to work under contract with these people, because it is easier for Russia and that does not allow stealing of the money.</p>\r\n<p>During the presentation of the study, it was inaugurated a photo exhibition entitled \"Children of War\", that is showing the fate of children in the Russian-Ukrainian conflict. Now in the anti-terrorist operations zone, on the territory controlled by constitutional authorities, there are about 60,000 schoolchildren.</p>",

In our villages and cities, our diaspora, eliminated from the surveys as well as from the elections,\"</em> he added. </p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>He concludes that the process of change for the good, truly and completely, of Moldova can be started only by a <strong>strong president, resistant, a president of the people.</strong></p>\r\n<p><strong><iframe src=\"https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2FAndreiNastase.DA%2Fposts%2F1782169665339053&amp;width=500\" width=\"500\" height=\"248\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" style=\"border: none; overflow: hidden;\"></iframe></strong></p>\r\n<p> We remind you that the <a href=\"/en/news/political/1525/Notice-from-Maia-Sandu--The-single-nominee-did-not-%E2%80%9Edie%E2%80%9D-They-will-decide-after-the-second-survey.htm\" target=\"_blank\">PAS leader</a> wrote on her Facebook account that last night has ended \"the joined meeting of PAS, PPDA and PLDM teams to analyze the result of the first survey between those two\" nominees. </p>",

Also today, the former Minister of Education accused the Government that it has \"stolen her identity\", probably referring to the candidate Maia Laguta.",
                "Continut": "<p>The PAS nominee also says that the Government comes not with only one candidate, but three of them that are declared: <em><strong>\"Marian Lupu, Iurie Leanca and Mihai Ghimpu, but also with one that is not declared - Igor Dodon\"</strong></em>  </p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p><em>\"In this campaign the government does not come with just one candidate but with three declared candidates - Lupu,Leanca and Ghimpu but also with one unreported - Dodon. But there are a number of \"tick\" candidates whose goal is not to get votes, but to steal votes from others so in the finals, the official or unofficial candidates of the government would be favored,\"</em> stated the leader of PAS.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>Maia Sandu added that the Democratic Party continued to collect signatures even if their candidate had already been registered, <em>\"signatures that were intended for the \"tick\" candidates\"</em></p>\r\n<p><em><strong>\"The candidates that were registered in violation of legal procedure for checking the signatures are Valeriu Ghiletchi, Ana Gutu, Silvia Radu and Maia Laguta.\"</strong></em> Regarding to the last candidate, the leader of PAS says that she submitted to CEC empty lists, but which were already stamped by the municipalities, but the stamp must be applied only after the lists are completed.</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p><em><strong>\"This vile government for which is not enough stealing billions and using stolen money for the electoral campaign, then their thievery turns out to be cowardly as well, they do not dare to fight right through their own candidates, but stealing my identity hoping that they will stop me to continue to fight for the rendering of state institutions to citizens and stop the oligarchy,\" </strong></em>added Maia Sandu.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>We remind you that yesterday, the president of DA Platform, Andrei Nastase, published an election manifesto which, if reading between the lines, it contains more hints that he should be the joint candidate of the right wing opposition, at the Presidential elections. He concludes in its statement that Moldova process of change for the good, true and complete, can be started only by <strong>a strong president, resistant,</strong> a president of the people.  </p>",

We agreed to have a common approach to Moldova. That it would have a sound democratic life and to pursue a course that will be targeted towards Europe. We agreed that it would be unfair to get involved in the election process, to get involved for one candidate or another, without having interference in the election campaign,\"</em> said Romanian President.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>The President of Romania also added that Mogherini is supporting very much the idea of Moldova's joining to the European Union and the fact that Romania has a plan to support actively Moldova's European path.</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p><em>\"I found that Mrs. Mogherini is very open to the idea and I enjoyed it very much. It has been understood very well that Romania has not only a special interest, but also a legitimate interest in the smooth developing of things in Moldova, and we agreed to correlate much better our approaches regarding Moldova. This approaches obviously does not mean to interference in Moldova, but to support Moldova in its European democratic course in the most pure and most sincerely way.\"</em></p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>Mogherini and Johannis also spoke about the war in Syria: <em>\"Federica Mogherini agreed that the military option is not a solution to solve the conflict in Syria. Diplomatic approach is important. Even if the discussions between the US and Russia came at a small jam. EU wants to be a partner who facilitates the discussions. Romania is one of the few countries that still have an embassy in Syria. We are important because we have a valuable deep links with Syria. We have some contacts that are important to go through diplomatic channels,\"</em> said Klaus Johannis, at the end of the meeting with Mogherini.</p>",

                "lead": "The Russian hybrid war against Ukraine, Moscow's plans on Donbas and chaos that may follow are the topics of an interview given by Mikhailo Samus, expert at the Center for Army, Conversion and Disarmament in Kiev, to Deschide.MD news portal.",
                "Continut": "<p><strong>— Mr. Samus, Putin decreed in 2015 that any foreigner who does not have problems with the law, can become a mercenary in the Russian Army. What is meant by \"does not have problems with the law\"? </strong></p>\r\n<p>— First of all, if we talk about Donbas separatists who fought against Ukraine and then passed in the Russian Army, on contract basis, I do not think anyone asked any criminal record. They have recommendations from their military superior commanders. If that man does not appear in the judiciary database in Russia, then it can be a mercenary with no problem.</p>\r\n<p><strong>— </strong><strong>However, if I am a citizen of Moldova and I want to become a mercenary in the Russian Army, do I need a document certifying that I am not prosecuted in Moldova?</strong></p>\r\n<p>— Yes, maybe you need a criminal record that would be translated into Russian and with a signature.</p>\r\n<p><strong>– Why exactly do you link Putin's decision regarding to mercenary in the Russian Army?</strong></p>\r\n<p>– After signing in Minsk appeared on the question of transfer of military forces from the fire line in a legal framework. The Russians had a serious agency in Donbas battalions that were subordinate to different Russian military entities - GRU or some Cossack formations. It was very difficult to drive all these structures. Motorized units and tanks that came from Russia fought in Debaltsevo, and had, of course, Russian commission. Then the Russians have realized that there was a very clear interaction between the Russian units and the units that were subordinated we do not know to whom, and various Cossacks and Hetmans. These people - who were on their own – could have run any time, they were not reliable. Due to this the Russian army was working on their own near Debaltsevo. The problem to organize these people appeared then.  It was decided to work on the principle of the Territorial Army center. An official team was created from officers, commissions and battalions’ commanders. The people that were not a part of any legal structure were attached to this team. In this way the things were regulated on different directions: statistics, leadership, logistics and thus it led to normality. Therefore, the decision on the change of the legislation was taken, so everyone who fought for the realization of the Novorossiya project could have an official status.</p>\r\n<p><strong>— On August 26<sup>th</sup>, Ukraine and the so-called people’s republics Donetsk and Lugansk came to an agreement on the fire stop in the demarcation area, in order to let the children to go to school. In what way is obeyed this agreement?</strong></p>\r\n<p>— The Minsk format supposes the participation of Russia, Ukraine, OSCE and the officials of the so called People’s Republics. In this format was signed the agreement. It was agreed that both sides would be at least at one km distance. Although, each day a soldier or two dies and several are injured. This is the last month statistics.</p>\r\n<p><strong>— OSCE is pressuring the Moldovan side to accept some concessions towards Transnistria and to offer it a special status within the Republic of Moldova. Is being prepared a precedent for Donbas?</strong></p>\r\n<p>— It is clear, it is the same algorithm. Russia works in Donbas after the Transnistrian model. It is clear that Russia uses the same clichés in order to keep the influence in the region, the control over Ukraine, over Moldova, Moscow simply does not want to allow Ukraine and Moldova to develop faster than Russia. In this sense Russia uses international organizations to achieve its goals: cultural, political, religion. OSCE is one of the tools that Russia uses to achieve its objectives as long as this organization allows this. As long as Russia finances OSCE, it has the possibility to influence it. Because all countries are a part of OSCE, among them are countries that are not supporting the Russian policy, but there are others who are Eurosceptic and are supporting Putin. <em>As long as there are conflicts as Transnistrian one, OSCE will exist as well.</em></p>\r\n<p><strong>— Good definition!</strong></p>\r\n<p>— Actually, OSCE was created to monitor the <em>Helsinki Protocol</em>, which Russia has violated when revised the borders while the annexation of Crimea. Therefore, was raised the issue to edit this protocol, because the borders started to change.  </p>\r\n<p><strong>— Can really the people that live on the territory occupied by the separatists and that come to Ukraine to get their pensions (these <em>pensioner</em> <em>tourists</em>, as they are called), can they change the situation in the auto proclaimed republics? They understand the fact that their situation is worse than before. </strong></p>\r\n<p>—The paradox is in the fact that these people are in the negation stage. They say that what happened in Ukraine is due to the Maidan. They will not ever recognize that on their shoulders came the “Russian world”. If they declare that in Donbas the living is worse, it means they will state that were wrong and stupid and were fooled. No, they say, it is the fault of Maidan! If there was no Maidan, they think they would have a great life with Ianukovici further. Even in the freed cities are people – 30% of them – that await the comeback of the Russian world. They support Russia. Their number is not changing: it is a stable group.</p>\r\n<p><strong>— How different is the approach from Minsk in the Russia case, Ukraine’s one?</strong></p>\r\n<p>— The agreements from Minsk, formally, are very positive documents. It contains traditional ways to solve conflicts applied in the last 10 years worldwide. It is about the ceasefire, withdrawing of the parts from the borderline, period of stabilization, and then, the political settlement of the conflict. However, the document is elaborated so that it does not contain any time algorith, there are no clear deadlines: when these stages must be completed nor written the succession of steps. The Ukrainian side demands that, firstly, to be ceased fire and then armed forces to be removed from the demarcation line, ultimately, to introduce an international armed military troops. The Russian armed forces to be withdrawn from the territory under the regulation of this contingent. All the local military formations are going to be disarmed. A stabilization period would follow, when law and constitutional order would be established. Only after this, we could move to free elections in the region. Russia, on the contrary, requires firstly the beginning of the cease fire, then remove parts of the demarcation line and afterwards, proceed to elections in the region. Ukraine should allow elections there and give a special status to those territories. Only after that, the disarmament, i.e. the withdrawal of Russian military troops from Donbas will start. Everyone realizes that if this scenario is going to be implemented, in Ukraine will appear more regions and minorities to require a special status within Ukraine: Trans Carpathian Russians, Romanians in Chernivtsi, Hungarians in the west, Bulgarians in the south, Poles in the northwest. A plan that will cause chaos!</p>",

However, for now, in the illegal elections over Dniester were registered only three candidates. Yevgeny Shevchuk, Irina Vasilachi, known for several interviews that present the corruption near the company of the leader from Tiraspol, as well as the former Minister of Internal Affairs after he was dismissed by the separatist power from Tiraspol last year, Ghenadi Kuzmicev.

I want to tell Mr. Dodon that a head of state must be honest to the people, but the judgement should be done by the people. Each of us has the right to express his opinion. So God help us, through forgiveness, repentance, patience and prayers that are done from St. Mount Athos to orthodox villages worldwide\"</em>, declared to us Igor Grigoriev. </p>\r\n<p>Asked why he chose such an attitude and how to parse his message, Dodon has told us: <em>\"I have not sent such messages. I think he wants to develop the subject. I just wrote him not to bother me and my family.\"</em></p>\r\n<p>Igor Grigoriev also commented Ilan Shor's accusations that have been made in a post on Facebook after the publication of his interview.</p>\r\n<p><em>\"It is natural to have a reaction because they were concerned, but I did not do any personal attacks, unlike them. I said bluntly, about one, and the other. Ilan Shor claims to have become a politician, party leader, with the party called by his name, a total aberration and amorality, which only proves what I mentioned in the interview: he is only concerned with his image and uses a whole team for cynical purposes. The worst is that he uses and manipulates people. It is obvious that what I said is nothing but the truth and truth hurts, but Mr. Dodon and Shor are not statesmen, but are politicians - people who deceive or outmaneuver others for personal gain</em>\", added Grigoriev.</p>\r\n<p>At the same time, the former chief of the staff of Ilan Shor, denied the statement of Orhei mayor, that said he has fired Grigoriev for dealing with politics and not the interests of the people. Grigoriev sent us a copy of the resignation request from \"Klassika Asigurari\" and told us that a similar one must be at the Orhei city hall, confirming his voluntary resignation from the position of deputy mayor.</p>\r\n<p>\n\t\t\t<div class=\"cs_img \"  style=\"width:684.6px;\">\n\t\t\t <p><a href=\"/images/cms-image-000002505.jpg\" class=\"photoViewer\" title=\"\"> \t\t\t\t<img src=\"/get_img?ImageRatio=30&amp;ImageWidth=684&amp;ImageHeight=941&amp;ImageId=2505\"   border=\"0\"/>\n\t\t\t </a></p> \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\n</p>\r\n<p>As said in the interview about financing Igor Dodon's campaign and the subsequent reaction of the PSRM leader, Grigoriev also reminded the statements of Ilan Shor where he talks about the money he gave to Dodon in 2011.</p>\r\n<p><iframe src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/8EbUgzvX-4o\" width=\"700\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\"></iframe></p>\r\n<p>Igor Grigoriev gave <a href=\"/ro/stiri/politic/1457/INTERVIU--Igor-Grigoriev-Shor-mi-a-recunoscut-c%C4%83-l-a-finan%C5%A3at-pe-Dodon-%C3%AEmpreun%C4%83-cu-Platon.htm\" target=\"_blank\">an interview</a> to Deschide.MD news portal, where he made several revelations revelations.

The file was started on the fact of granting Moldovan citizenship to an Italian who is accused of immigrants' seizure in his country. The target of the investigation is none other than the former head of state - Vladimir Voronin.",
                "Continut": "<p>Deschide.MD editorial office found out about this case from the scheduled hearings from the Buiucani Law Court. Today, at 4:15 p.m., there will be pronounced the decision on the file Cesare Lodeserto against the Presidency of Moldova. The Italian citizen sued the President Nicolae Timofti after he withdrew the citizenship granted by Voronin, following inquiries from the investigative bodies.</p>\r\n<p><em>\"The commission near the President of Moldova, which examines the applications for granting or withdrawing citizenship, received a file from the Ministry of Information Technology and Communications (MITC), which requested and argued the need to withdraw the citizenship of Moldova from the citizen Cesare Lodeserto. The dossier came from MITC, because this is the procedure, but they did it at the request of the Security and Intelligence Service (SIS),</em>\" explained to us the Secretary General, Ion Paduraru, pointing out that this is the third case when the present head of state withdraws somebody's citizenship. </p>\r\n<p>\n\t\t\t<div class=\"cs_img \"  style=\"width:700px;\">\n\t\t\t <p><a href=\"/images/cms-image-000002540.jpg\" class=\"photoViewer\" title=\"\"> \t\t\t\t<img src=\"/get_img?ImageRatio=70&amp;ImageWidth=700&amp;ImageHeight=933&amp;ImageId=2540\"   border=\"0\"/>\n\t\t\t </a></p> \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\n</p>\r\n<p>If to retrace the story's steps, we find out that on the name of the Italian citizen Lodeserto was started also a criminal case on the fact of granting his citizenship in the spring of 2015.</p>\r\n<p><em>\"Based on an exchange of information received from our counterparts, we started a criminal dossier in order to check effectively and qualitatively the received data. At one point, I understood that there is about ultra vires, (art. 328, Penal Code) not about human trafficking, so we have forwarded the dossier to Anti-Corruption Prosecutor's Office,</em>\" stated to us Iurie Podarilov, chief of the Center for combating trafficking in human beings in the Ministry of Internal Affairs (MIA).</p>\r\n<p>We could not find out details from the Anticorruption Prosecutor's Office, while the chief prosecutor - Viorel Morari - has disconnected the phone during the whole day of Monday, inclusively today, until the publication time of this article. His colleagues told us that Morari is on a business trip. We managed to find out from the Deputy of the institution, Adrian Popenco, that the case is under investigation and has not been dismissed. We could not find out if Voronin already has a statute in this investigation or whether he is to be given one.</p>\r\n<p>Instead, in addition to the statements collected by the responsible institutions, we obtained several documents from which, undoubtedly, results that Vladimir Voronin will be investigated criminal in this case. Therefore, in the <em>Informative Note</em>, the document by which Voronin was informed that the Italian wants Moldovan citizenship, along with his comrade of Romanian origin, namely the former president writes: <em>\"I agree for both\"</em> and undersigns.</p>\r\n<p>Vladimir Voronin decided to make the Italian into a Moldovan with proper acts, despite the fact that Artur Reshetnikov - his advisor, then - proposed him the rejection of this request. This is formulated in the first informative note, which dates from February 2006. Voronin preferred, however, another alternative: to accept, but to check the \"criminal past\" of the applicants for citizenship.</p>\r\n<p>\n\t\t\t<div class=\"cs_img \"  style=\"width:700px;\">\n\t\t\t <p><a href=\"/images/cms-image-000002542.JPG\" class=\"photoViewer\" title=\"\"> \t\t\t\t<img src=\"/get_img?ImageRatio=70&amp;ImageWidth=700&amp;ImageHeight=933&amp;ImageId=2542\"   border=\"0\"/>\n\t\t\t </a></p> \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\n</p>\r\n<p>Six months later, Reshetnicov comes back with a second informative note, where he tells Voronin that after the checking, <em>the Moldovan Embassy in Italy was informed on the telephone by the Prefecture of Lecce that, following the accusations of human sequestration, abuse of means of correction and violence against immigrants in the center of the \"Regina Pacis\", <strong>the prosecution's office filed a criminal dossier on the name of Mr. Lodeserto</strong>, the case is still being investigated.</em></p>\r\n<p>It’s curious that even this fact did not stop Voronin to decide: <strong><em>\"</em></strong> <strong><em>I agree for both\". </em></strong></p>\r\n<div>\n\t\t\t<div class=\"cs_img \"  style=\"width:700px;\">\n\t\t\t <p><a href=\"/images/cms-image-000002541.jpg\" class=\"photoViewer\" title=\"\"> \t\t\t\t<img src=\"/get_img?ImageRatio=70&amp;ImageWidth=700&amp;ImageHeight=933&amp;ImageId=2541\"   border=\"0\"/>\n\t\t\t </a></p> \t\t\t\t\t</div>\n\t\n</div>\r\n<div>\r\n<p>We tried to get an explanation from the Communist leader, but the party communicators have told us that they would give us a reaction only when they have the opportunity to discuss the subject with Vladimir Voronin. For now, they say, the agenda does not allow this.</p>\r\n<p>The editorial office of Deschide.MD will return with a reaction from the former president, obviously, if he will offer one. </p>\r\n<p>According to the law, the ultra vires, committed by a person holding a public dignity position, shall be punished with imprisonment from 6 to 10 years with deprivation of the right to occupy certain positions or to practice certain activities for a period of 10 to 15 years.</p>\r\n</div>",

                "lead": "The Political Party “Platform Dignity and Truth” (PPDA) nominee for President considers that the geopolitics is not that significant, more important are the projects for the country.  \" The people do not have what to eat, but the politicians tell them about Russian tanks, nonexistent customs unions or European miracles from the TV set.”, specified Andrei Nastase.",
                "Continut": "<p>In an interview for <a href=\"http://ipn.md/en/politica/79532\" target=\"_blank\">IPN</a>, the PPDA candidate, also says that he would like Moldova to become a full member of the EU, but \"does not want to lie to people, promising them something that now is unreal.\"</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p><em>\"<strong>The geopolitical aspect brought as much evil as the politicians who divided society based on this criterion. The people do not have what to eat, but they tell them about Russian tanks, inexistent customs unions or European miracles from the TV set.</strong> The politicians deserve the people’s vote first of all for the projects that they intend to implement for the country, for the people who live here. I want the Republic of Moldova to become a fully-fledged member of the EU, but I do not want to lie to the people, promising them something that is now unreal. We should start work and free justice from captivity and bring it to a European level. We should begin a harsh fight against grand and petty corruption. We must remove the oligarchs and criminals from power. By each accomplishment, we come closer to a European Moldova\",</em> also stated Nastase.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>Among the top five priorities of the PPDA candidate for president, Andrei Nastase mentioned:</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p><em>\"1. Clarification of the thefts of the billions of lei by an international investigation into the banking frauds and money laundering cases, contribution to recovering the money, penalization of the thieves and utilization of all the legal means possible to free the people from the obligation to repay the stolen billions of lei.<br />2. Transformation of the people’s socioeconomic demands into legislative initiatives, with the rise in pensions up to the level of the minimum consumer basket at least, stimulation of the private initiative and national and foreign investments that would generate new, well-paid jobs and would motivate the young people to remain at home, decentralization, modernization of towns, rehabilitation of villages and development of agriculture being among the top priorities.<br />3. Submission of a legislative initiative concerning the reformation of the justice sector and fighting of grand and petty corruption, with the appointment of an independent prosecutor general, the transformation of the National Anticorruption Center into the National Anticorruption Directorate, freeing of anticorruption institutions from political influence, lustration extended up to now, extended confiscation of the property of state officials, prosecutors and judges and of their relatives if these cannot prove the source of income being among the priorities.<br />4. Initiation of early legislative elections as soon as possible.<br />5. Promotion of internal and external policy aimed at restoring the confidence of the Moldovan people and foreign partners in the national political class and the Republic of Moldova.\"</em></p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>Andrei Nastase believes that the president must be a player that aims to be the guarantor of citizens: <em>\"In this corrupt system that is practically fully subordinated to Plahotniuc and his company, <strong>only a powerful President can lay the foundations for the renovation of the political class and can provoke early parliamentary elections and plead for positive changes</strong> that would ensure decent living conditions and would return things in in Moldova to normality.\"</em></p>",

We hope that greater engagement - and a more active one - both of the Bureau and all Moldovan authorities will allow the gradual change of the situation from the field\"</em>, said the Deputy Prime Minister for Reintegration.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>In turn, Meier-Klodt, stated that he supports the commitment of the Moldovan leadership regarding the development of the concept for Transnistria. </p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p><em>\"I am pleased to hear from Mr. Balan that they will further discuss the issues that have not been discussed so far. I welcome the Government of the Republic of Moldova for that public commitment that, early next year, will be created the new political concept, which will meet the international recognized parameters, and will stimulate the Transnistrian settlement process. I welcome also the strengthening and extension of the Bureau of Reintegration, so that it can also act better,\"</em> stated the German official. </p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>The Deputy Prime Minister for Reintegration, Gheorge Balan added that last night they had a meeting with the Russian Deputy Prime Minister, Dmitry Rogozin, and today they will have another meeting with him.</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p><em>„Ieri, pe parcursul serii, am avut o întrevedere cu domnul Rogozin, după care a plecat la Tiraspol. Și astăzi vom mai avea o întâlnire unde vom discuta despre mai multe subiecte ce țin de reglementarea transnistreană. Atmosfera era una pozitivă și sper că vom avea și mișcări pozitive în acest sens”,</em> a adăugat Bălan.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>Special Representative of the OSCE Chairperson-in-Office for the Transnistrian Settlement Process on behalf of Germany was yesterday in Tiraspol and met with the alleged foreign minister from Tiraspol, Vitali Ignatiev, was complaining that Chisinau doesn't respect and doesn't implement the Berlin protocol, signed this summer. According to Ignatiev, the negotiations with Chisinau depreciated substantially.</p>\r\n<p>We remind you that Dmitry Rogozin, the special representative of the president Vladimir Putin for the Transnistrian region, is visiting Moldova, and also pays a visit to Tiraspol. The Russian Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Rogozin previously postponed his visit to Moldova, which was to be held on October 4-5.</p>\r\n<p><iframe src=\"http://www.privesc.eu/widget/live/69394\" width=\"758\" height=\"370\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe></p>",

The most important thing is that we managed, on the background of political and financial crisis, to mobilize the institutions suffering from the crisis</em>,\"</em> stated Andrian Candu.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>Candu also referred to the importance of the Roadmap on priority reform agenda in implementing commitments to foreign partners, including by synchronizing the agendas of Parliament and Government. </p>\r\n<p>According to the Speaker of the Parliament, the implementation rate of about 95% of the document denoted a development trend, which was appreciated by the EU too.</p>\r\n<blockquote>\r\n<p><em>\"The Roadmap was a very effective tool for mobilization. Although it was a document in response to crisis, it managed to return us in implementing the Association Agreement and to relaunch reforms that stagnated. Although there were arrears in the spring session, they were liquidated in the current session by taking responsibility by the government. It was not easy, but it has been shown that if there is political will, you can do a lot,\" </em>said Andrian Candu.</p>\r\n</blockquote>\r\n<p>The Speaker assured that in the next period, all actions related to reforms assumed under the Roadmap would be completed, as the implementation of the Association Agreement remained a priority for Parliament. Adrian Candu said that parliamentary hearing had been organized as regards the results of implementing the provisions of the Deep and Comprehensive Free Trade Agreement between Moldova and EU, as well as developments in the energy sector of the country. According to the Speaker the hearings on achievements and arrears in implementing the laws on justice reform would be organized in the coming days.</p>\r\n<p>The Speaker of the Parliament also referred to the priorities for the next period focused on relaunch of cooperation with IMF and signing a new country program, remediation and consolidation of the financial-banking sector, ensuring energy security, justice reform, as well as monitoring effective implementation of laws adopted by Parliament.</p>",
